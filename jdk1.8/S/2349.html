  InputMethodRequests defines the requests that a text editing component
  has to handle in order to work with input methods. The component
  can implement this interface itself or use a separate object that
  implements it. The object implementing this interface must be returned
  from the component's getInputMethodRequests method.
  <p>
  The text editing component also has to provide an input method event
  listener.
  </p><p>
  The interface is designed to support one of two input user interfaces:
  </p><ul><li><em>on-the-spot</em> input, where the composed text is displayed as part
      of the text component's text body.
  </li><li><em>below-the-spot</em> input, where the composed text is displayed in
      a separate composition window just below the insertion point where
      the text will be inserted when it is committed. Note that, if text is
      selected within the component's text body, this text will be replaced by
      the committed text upon commitment; therefore it is not considered part
      of the context that the text is input into.
  </li></ul>

<div class="comment">
      Gets the location of a specified offset in the current composed text,
      or of the selection in committed text.
      This information is, for example, used to position the candidate window
      near the composed text, or a composition window near the location
      where committed text will be inserted.
      <p>
      If the component has composed text (because the most recent
      InputMethodEvent sent to it contained composed text), then the offset is
      relative to the composed text - offset 0 indicates the first character
      in the composed text. The location returned should be for this character.
      </p><p>
      If the component doesn't have composed text, the offset should be ignored,
      and the location returned should reflect the beginning (in line
      direction) of the highlight in the last line containing selected text.
      For example, for horizontal left-to-right text (such as English), the
      location to the left of the left-most character on the last line
      containing selected text is returned. For vertical top-to-bottom text,
      with lines proceeding from right to left, the location to the top of the
      left-most line containing selected text is returned.
      </p><p>
      The location is represented as a 0-thickness caret, that is, it has 0
      width if the text is drawn horizontally, and 0 height if the text is
      drawn vertically. Other text orientations need to be mapped to
      horizontal or vertical orientation. The rectangle uses absolute screen
      coordinates.
      @param offset the offset within the composed text, if there is composed
      text; null otherwise
      @return a rectangle representing the screen location of the offset</p></div>

      Gets the offset within the composed text for the specified absolute x
      and y coordinates on the screen. This information is used, for example
      to handle mouse clicks and the mouse cursor. The offset is relative to
      the composed text, so offset 0 indicates the beginning of the composed
      text.
      <p>
      Return null if the location is outside the area occupied by the composed
      text.
      @param x the absolute x coordinate on screen

      Gets the offset of the insert position in the committed text contained
      in the text editing component. This is the offset at which characters

      Gets an iterator providing access to the entire text and attributes
      contained in the text editing component except for uncommitted
      text. Uncommitted (composed) text should be ignored for index
      calculations and should not be made accessible through the iterator.
      <p>
      The input method may provide a list of attributes that it is
      interested in. In that case, information about other attributes that
      the implementor may have need not be made accessible through the

      Gets the latest committed text from the text editing component and
      removes it from the component's text body.
      This is used for the "Undo Commit" feature in some input methods, where
      the committed text reverts to its previous composed state. The composed
      text will be sent to the component using an InputMethodEvent.
      <p>
      Generally, this feature should only be supported immediately after the
      text was committed, not after the user performed other operations on the
      text. When the feature is not supported, return null.

      The input method may provide a list of attributes that it is

      Gets the currently selected text from the text editing component.
      This may be used for a variety of purposes.
      One of them is the "Reconvert" feature in some input methods.
      In this case, the input method will typically send an input method event
      to replace the selected text with composed text. Depending on the input
      method's capabilities, this may be the original composed text for the
      selected text, the latest composed text entered anywhere in the text, or
      a version of the text that's converted back from the selected text.

      The input method may provide a list of attributes that it is
