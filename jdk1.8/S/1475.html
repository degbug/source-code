  A field of date-time, such as month-of-year or hour-of-minute.
  <p>
  Date and time is expressed using fields which partition the time-line into something
  meaningful for humans. Implementations of this interface represent those fields.
  </p><p>
  The most commonly used units are defined in {@link ChronoField}.
  Further fields are supplied in {@link IsoFields}, {@link WeekFields} and {@link JulianFields}.
  Fields can also be written by application code by implementing this interface.
  </p><p>
  The field works using double dispatch. Client code calls methods on a date-time like
  <code>LocalDateTime</code> which check if the field is a <code>ChronoField</code>.
  If it is, then the date-time must handle it.
  Otherwise, the method call is re-dispatched to the matching method in this interface.
  @implSpec
  This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
  All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
  Implementations should be <code>Serializable</code> where possible.
  An enum is as effective implementation choice.
  @since 1.8</p></div>

      The unit of the field is the period that varies within the range.

      Gets the range that the field is bound by.

      The range of the field is the period that the field varies within.
      For example, in the field 'MonthOfYear', the range is 'Years'.
      See also {@link #getBaseUnit()}.
      </p><p>
      The range is never null. For example, the 'Year' field is shorthand for
      'YearOfForever'. It therefore has a unit of 'Years' and a range of 'Forever'.

      Get the range of valid values for this field using the temporal object to

      This uses the temporal object to find the range of valid values for the field.
      This is similar to {@link #range()}, however this method refines the result
      using the temporal. For example, if the field is <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> the
      <code>range</code> method is not accurate as there are four possible month lengths,
      28, 29, 30 and 31 days. Using this method with a date allows the range to be

      Resolves this field to provide a simpler alternative or a date.
      <p>
      This method is invoked during the resolve phase of parsing.
      It is designed to allow application defined fields to be simplified into
      more standard fields, such as those on <code>ChronoField</code>, or into a date.
      </p><p>
      Applications should not normally invoke this method directly.
      @implSpec
      If an implementation represents a field that can be simplified, or
      combined with others, then this method must be implemented.
      </p><p>
      The specified map contains the current state of the parse.
      The map is mutable and must be mutated to resolve the field and
      any related fields. This method will only be invoked during parsing
      if the map contains this field, and implementations should therefore
      assume this field is present.
      </p><p>
      Resolving a field will consist of looking at the value of this field,
      and potentially other fields, and either updating the map with a
      simpler value, such as a <code>ChronoField</code>, or returning a
      complete <code>ChronoLocalDate</code>. If a resolve is successful,
      the code must remove all the fields that were resolved from the map,
      including this field.
      </p><p>
      For example, the <code>IsoFields</code> class contains the quarter-of-year
      and day-of-quarter fields. The implementation of this method in that class
      resolves the two fields plus the {@link ChronoField#YEAR YEAR} into a
      complete <code>LocalDate</code>. The resolve method will remove all three
      fields from the map before returning the <code>LocalDate</code>.
      </p><p>
      A partially complete temporal is used to allow the chronology and zone
      to be queried. In general, only the chronology will be needed.
      Querying items other than the zone or chronology is undefined and
      must not be relied on.
      The behavior of other methods such as <code>get</code>, <code>getLong</code>,
      <code>range</code> and <code>isSupported</code> is unpredictable and the results undefined.
      </p><p>
      If resolution should be possible, but the data is invalid, the resolver
      style should be used to determine an appropriate level of leniency, which
      may require throwing a <code>DateTimeException</code> or <code>ArithmeticException</code>.
      If no resolution is possible, the resolve method must return null.
      </p><p>
      When resolving time fields, the map will be altered and null returned.
      When resolving date fields, the date is normally returned from the method,
      with the map altered to remove the resolved fields. However, it would also
      be acceptable for the date fields to be resolved into other <code>ChronoField</code>
      instances that can produce a date, such as <code>EPOCH_DAY</code>.
      </p><p>
      Not all <code>TemporalAccessor</code> implementations are accepted as return values.
      Implementations that call this method must accept <code>ChronoLocalDate</code>,
      <code>ChronoLocalDateTime</code>, <code>ChronoZonedDateTime</code> and <code>LocalTime</code>.
      </p><p>
      The default implementation must return null.
      @param fieldValues  the map of fields to values, which can be updated, not null
      @param partialTemporal  the partially complete temporal to query for zone and
       chronology; querying for other things is undefined and not recommended, not null
      @param resolverStyle  the requested type of resolve, not null
      @return the resolved temporal object; null if resolving only
       changed the map, or no resolve occurred
      @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
      @throws DateTimeException if resolving results in an error. This must not be thrown
       by querying a field on the temporal without first checking if it is supported</p></div>
