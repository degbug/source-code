  A KeyEventPostProcessor cooperates with the current KeyboardFocusManager
  in the final resolution of all unconsumed KeyEvents. KeyEventPostProcessors
  registered with the current KeyboardFocusManager will receive KeyEvents
  after the KeyEvents have been dispatched to and handled by their targets.
  KeyEvents that would have been otherwise discarded because no Component in
  the application currently owns the focus will also be forwarded to
  registered KeyEventPostProcessors. This will allow applications to implement
  features that require global KeyEvent post-handling, such as menu shortcuts.
  <p>
  Note that the KeyboardFocusManager itself implements KeyEventPostProcessor.
  By default, the current KeyboardFocusManager will be the final
  KeyEventPostProcessor in the chain. The current KeyboardFocusManager cannot
  be completely deregistered as a KeyEventPostProcessor. However, if a
  KeyEventPostProcessor reports that no further post-processing of the
  KeyEvent should take place, the AWT will consider the event fully handled
  and will take no additional action with regard to the event. (While it is
  possible for client code to register the current KeyboardFocusManager as
  a KeyEventPostProcessor one or more times, this is usually unnecessary and
  not recommended.)

      This method is called by the current KeyboardFocusManager, requesting
      that this KeyEventPostProcessor perform any necessary post-processing
      which should be part of the KeyEvent's final resolution. At the time
      this method is invoked, typically the KeyEvent has already been
      dispatched to and handled by its target. However, if no Component in
      the application currently owns the focus, then the KeyEvent has not
      been dispatched to any Component. Typically, KeyEvent post-processing
      will be used to implement features which require global KeyEvent
      post-handling, such as menu shortcuts. Note that if a
      KeyEventPostProcessor wishes to dispatch the KeyEvent, it must use
      <code>redispatchEvent</code> to prevent the AWT from recursively
      requesting that this KeyEventPostProcessor perform post-processing
      of the event again.
      <p>
      If an implementation of this method returns <code>false</code>, then the
      KeyEvent is passed to the next KeyEventPostProcessor in the chain,
      ending with the current KeyboardFocusManager. If an implementation
      returns <code>true</code>, the KeyEvent is assumed to have been fully
      handled (although this need not be the case), and the AWT will take no
      further action with regard to the KeyEvent. If an implementation
      consumes the KeyEvent but returns <code>false</code>, the consumed
      event will still be passed to the next KeyEventPostProcessor in the
      chain. It is important for developers to check whether the KeyEvent has
      been consumed before performing any post-processing of the KeyEvent. By
      default, the current KeyboardFocusManager will perform no post-
      processing in response to a consumed KeyEvent.
      @param e the KeyEvent to post-process
      @return <code>true</code> if the AWT should take no further action with
              regard to the KeyEvent; <code>false</code> otherwise
