  <em>Functional interfaces</em> provide target types for lambda expressions
  and method references.  Each functional interface has a single abstract
  method, called the <em>functional method</em> for that functional interface,
  to which the lambda expression's parameter and return types are matched or
  adapted.  Functional interfaces can provide a target type in multiple
  contexts, such as assignment context, method invocation, or cast context:
  <pre>{@code
      // Assignment context
      Predicate<string> p = String::isEmpty;
      // Method invocation context
      stream.filter(e -&gt; e.getSize() &gt; 10)...
      // Cast context
      stream.map((ToIntFunction) e -&gt; e.getSize())...
  }</string></pre>
  <p>The interfaces in this package are general purpose functional interfaces
  used by the JDK, and are available to be used by user code as well.  While
  they do not identify a complete set of function shapes to which lambda
  expressions might be adapted, they provide enough to cover common
  requirements. Other functional interfaces provided for specific purposes,
  such as {@link java.io.FileFilter}, are defined in the packages where they
  are used.
  </p><p>The interfaces in this package are annotated with
  {@link java.lang.FunctionalInterface}. This annotation is not a requirement
  for the compiler to recognize an interface as a functional interface, but
  merely an aid to capture design intent and enlist the help of the compiler in
  identifying accidental violations of design intent.
  </p><p>Functional interfaces often represent abstract concepts like functions,
  actions, or predicates.  In documenting functional interfaces, or referring
  to variables typed as functional interfaces, it is common to refer directly
  to those abstract concepts, for example using "this function" instead of
  "the function represented by this object".  When an API method is said to
  accept or return a functional interface in this manner, such as "applies the
  provided function to...", this is understood to mean a <i>non-null</i>
  reference to an object implementing the appropriate functional interface,
  unless potential nullity is explicitly specified.
  </p><p>The functional interfaces in this package follow an extensible naming
  convention, as follows:
  </p><ul><li>There are several basic function shapes, including
      {@link java.util.function.Function} (unary function from <code>T</code> to <code>R</code>),
      {@link java.util.function.Consumer} (unary function from <code>T</code> to <code>void</code>),
      {@link java.util.function.Predicate} (unary function from <code>T</code> to <code>boolean</code>),
      and {@link java.util.function.Supplier} (nilary function to <code>R</code>).
      </li><li>Function shapes have a natural arity based on how they are most
      commonly used.  The basic shapes can be modified by an arity prefix to
      indicate a different arity, such as
      {@link java.util.function.BiFunction} (binary function from <code>T</code> and
      <code>U</code> to <code>R</code>).
      </li><li>There are additional derived function shapes which extend the basic
      function shapes, including {@link java.util.function.UnaryOperator}
      (extends <code>Function</code>) and {@link java.util.function.BinaryOperator}
      (extends <code>BiFunction</code>).
      </li><li>Type parameters of functional interfaces can be specialized to
      primitives with additional type prefixes.  To specialize the return type
      for a type that has both generic return type and generic arguments, we
      prefix <code>ToXxx</code>, as in {@link java.util.function.ToIntFunction}.
      Otherwise, type arguments are specialized left-to-right, as in
      {@link java.util.function.DoubleConsumer}
      or {@link java.util.function.ObjIntConsumer}.
      (The type prefix <code>Obj</code> is used to indicate that we don't want to
      specialize this parameter, but want to move on to the next parameter,
      as in {@link java.util.function.ObjIntConsumer}.)
      These schemes can be combined, as in <code>IntToDoubleFunction</code>.
      </li><li>If there are specialization prefixes for all arguments, the arity
      prefix may be left out (as in {@link java.util.function.ObjIntConsumer}).
      </li>
  </ul>
