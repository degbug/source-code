  Interface Doc specifies the interface for an object that supplies one piece
  of print data for a Print Job. "Doc" is a short, easy-to-pronounce term
  that means "a piece of print data." The client passes to the Print Job an
  object that implements interface Doc, and the Print Job calls methods on
  that object to obtain the print data. The Doc interface lets a Print Job:
  <ul>
  <li>
  Determine the format, or "doc flavor" (class <a href="../S/3764.html#L446" title="Defined at 446 in src/javax/print/DocFlavor.java.">DocFlavor</a>),
  in which the print data is available. A doc flavor designates the print
  data format (a MIME type) and the representation class of the object
  from which the print data comes.
  <p>
  </p></li><li>
  Obtain the print data representation object, which is an instance of the
  doc flavor's representation class. The Print Job can then obtain the actual
  print data from the representation object.
  <p>
  </p></li><li>
  Obtain the printing attributes that specify additional characteristics of
  the doc or that specify processing instructions to be applied to the doc.
  Printing attributes are defined in package {@link javax.print.attribute
  javax.print.attribute}. The doc returns its printing attributes stored in
  an {@link javax.print.attribute.DocAttributeSet javax.print.attribute.DocAttributeSet}.
  </li></ul>
  <p>
  Each method in an implementation of interface Doc is permitted always to
  return the same object each time the method is called.
  This has implications
  for a Print Job or other caller of a doc object whose print data
  representation object "consumes" the print data as the caller obtains the
  print data, such as a print data representation object which is a stream.
  Once the Print Job has called {@link #getPrintData()
  getPrintData()} and obtained the stream, any further calls to
  {@link #getPrintData() getPrintData()} will return the same
  stream object upon which reading may already be in progress, <i>not</i> a new
  stream object that will re-read the print data from the beginning. Specifying
  a doc object to behave this way simplifies the implementation of doc objects,
  and is justified on the grounds that a particular doc is intended to convey
  print data only to one Print Job, not to several different Print Jobs. (To
  convey the same print data to several different Print Jobs, you have to
  create several different doc objects on top of the same print data source.)
  </p><p>
  Interface Doc affords considerable implementation flexibility. The print data
  might already be in existence when the doc object is constructed. In this
  case the objects returned by the doc's methods can be supplied to the doc's
  constructor, be stored in the doc ahead of time, and simply be returned when
  called for. Alternatively, the print data might not exist yet when the doc
  object is constructed. In this case the doc object might provide a "lazy"
  implementation that generates the print data representation object (and/or
  the print data) only when the Print Job calls for it (when the Print Job
  calls the {@link #getPrintData() getPrintData()} method).
  </p><p>
  There is no restriction on the number of client threads that may be
  simultaneously accessing the same doc. Therefore, all implementations of
  interface Doc must be designed to be multiple thread safe.
  </p><p>
  However there can only be one consumer of the print data obtained from a
  Doc.
  </p><p>
  If print data is obtained from the client as a stream, by calling Doc's
  <code>getReaderForText()</code> or <code>getStreamForBytes()</code>
  methods, or because the print data source is already an InputStream or
  Reader, then the print service should always close these streams for the
  client on all job completion conditions. With the following caveat.
  If the print data is itself a stream, the service will always close it.
  If the print data is otherwise something that can be requested as a stream,
  the service will only close the stream if it has obtained the stream before
  terminating. That is, just because a print service might request data as
  a stream does not mean that it will, with the implications that Doc
  implementors which rely on the service to close them should create such
  streams only in response to a request from the service.
