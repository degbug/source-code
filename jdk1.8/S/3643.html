  This interface supports the creation of new files by an annotation
  processor.  Files created in this way will be known to the
  annotation processing tool implementing this interface, better
  enabling the tool to manage them.  Source and class files so
  created will be {@linkplain RoundEnvironment#getRootElements
  considered for processing} by the tool in a subsequent {@linkplain
  RoundEnvironment round of processing} after the <code>close</code>
  method has been called on the <code>Writer</code> or {@code
  OutputStream} used to write the contents of the file.
  Three kinds of files are distinguished: source files, class files,
  and auxiliary resource files.
  <p> There are two distinguished supported locations (subtrees
  within the logical file system) where newly created files are
  placed: one for {@linkplain
  javax.tools.StandardLocation#SOURCE_OUTPUT new source files}, and
  one for {@linkplain javax.tools.StandardLocation#CLASS_OUTPUT new
  class files}.  (These might be specified on a tool's command line,
  for example, using flags such as <code>-s</code> and <code>-d</code>.)  The
  actual locations for new source files and new class files may or
  may not be distinct on a particular run of the tool.  Resource
  files may be created in either location.  The methods for reading
  and writing resources take a relative name argument.  A relative
  name is a non-null, non-empty sequence of path segments separated
  by <code>'/'</code>; <code>'.'</code> and <code>'..'</code> are invalid path
  segments.  A valid relative name must match the
  "path-rootless" rule of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC 3986</a>, section
  3.3.
  </p><p>The file creation methods take a variable number of arguments to
  allow the <em>originating elements</em> to be provided as hints to
  the tool infrastructure to better manage dependencies.  The
  originating elements are the types or packages (representing {@code
  package-info} files) which caused an annotation processor to
  attempt to create a new file.  For example, if an annotation
  processor tries to create a source file, {@code
  GeneratedFromUserSource}, in response to processing
  </p><blockquote><pre>   @Generate
   public class UserSource {}
  </pre></blockquote>
  the type element for <code>UserSource</code> should be passed as part of
  the creation method call as in:
  <blockquote><pre>       filer.createSourceFile("GeneratedFromUserSource",
                              eltUtils.getTypeElement("UserSource"));
  </pre></blockquote>
  If there are no originating elements, none need to be passed.  This
  information may be used in an incremental environment to determine
  the need to rerun processors or remove generated files.
  Non-incremental environments may ignore the originating element
  information.
  <p> During each run of an annotation processing tool, a file with a
  given pathname may be created only once.  If that file already
  exists before the first attempt to create it, the old contents will
  be deleted.  Any subsequent attempt to create the same file during
  a run will throw a {@link FilerException}, as will attempting to
  create both a class file and source file for the same type name or
  same package name.  The {@linkplain Processor initial inputs} to
  the tool are considered to be created by the zeroth round;
  therefore, attempting to create a source or class file
  corresponding to one of those inputs will result in a {@link
  FilerException}.
  </p><p> In general, processors must not knowingly attempt to overwrite
  existing files that were not generated by some processor.  A {@code
  Filer} may reject attempts to open a file corresponding to an
  existing type, like <code>java.lang.Object</code>.  Likewise, the
  invoker of the annotation processing tool must not knowingly
  configure the tool such that the discovered processors will attempt
  to overwrite existing files that were not generated.
  </p><p> Processors can indicate a source or class file is generated by
  including an {@link javax.annotation.Generated @Generated}
  annotation.
  </p><p> Note that some of the effect of overwriting a file can be
  achieved by using a <i>decorator</i>-style pattern.  Instead of
  modifying a class directly, the class is designed so that either
  its superclass is generated by annotation processing or subclasses
  of the class are generated by annotation processing.  If the
  subclasses are generated, the parent class may be designed to use
  factories instead of public constructors so that only subclass
  instances would be presented to clients of the parent class.
