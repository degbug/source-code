  A <code>MidiChannel</code> object represents a single MIDI channel.
  Generally, each <code>MidiChannel</code> method processes a like-named MIDI
  "channel voice" or "channel mode" message as defined by the MIDI specification. However,
  <code>MidiChannel</code> adds some "get" methods  that retrieve the value
  most recently set by one of the standard MIDI channel messages.  Similarly,
  methods for per-channel solo and mute have been added.
  <p>
  A <code>{@link Synthesizer}</code> object has a collection
  of <code>MidiChannels</code>, usually one for each of the 16 channels
  prescribed by the MIDI 1.0 specification.  The <code>Synthesizer</code>
  generates sound when its <code>MidiChannels</code> receive
  <code>noteOn</code> messages.
  </p><p>
  See the MIDI 1.0 Specification for more information about the prescribed
  behavior of the MIDI channel messages, which are not exhaustively
  documented here.  The specification is titled <code>MIDI Reference:
  The Complete MIDI 1.0 Detailed Specification</code>, and is published by
  the MIDI Manufacturer's Association (<a href="http://www.midi.org">
  http://www.midi.org</a>).
  </p><p>
  MIDI was originally a protocol for reporting the gestures of a keyboard
  musician.  This genesis is visible in the <code>MidiChannel</code> API, which
  preserves such MIDI concepts as key number, key velocity, and key pressure.
  It should be understood that the MIDI data does not necessarily originate
  with a keyboard player (the source could be a different kind of musician, or
  software).  Some devices might generate constant values for velocity
  and pressure, regardless of how the note was performed.
  Also, the MIDI specification often leaves it up to the
  synthesizer to use the data in the way the implementor sees fit.  For
  example, velocity data need not always be mapped to volume and/or brightness.

      Reacts to a change in the specified controller's value.  A controller
      is some control other than a keyboard key, such as a
      switch, slider, pedal, wheel, or breath-pressure sensor.
      The MIDI 1.0 Specification provides standard numbers for typical
      controllers on MIDI devices, and describes the intended effect
      for some of the controllers.
      The way in which an
      <code>Instrument</code> reacts to a controller change may be
      specific to the <code>Instrument</code>.
      <p>
      The MIDI 1.0 Specification defines both 7-bit controllers
      and 14-bit controllers.  Continuous controllers, such
      as wheels and sliders, typically have 14 bits (two MIDI bytes),
      while discrete controllers, such as switches, typically have 7 bits
      (one MIDI byte).  Refer to the specification to see the
      expected resolution for each type of control.
      </p><p>
      Controllers 64 through 95 (0x40 - 0x5F) allow 7-bit precision.
      The value of a 7-bit controller is set completely by the
      <code>value</code> argument.  An additional set of controllers
      provide 14-bit precision by using two controller numbers, one
      for the most significant 7 bits and another for the least significant
      7 bits.  Controller numbers 0 through 31 (0x00 - 0x1F) control the
      most significant 7 bits of 14-bit controllers; controller numbers
      32 through 63 (0x20 - 0x3F) control the least significant 7 bits of
      these controllers.  For example, controller number 7 (0x07) controls
      the upper 7 bits of the channel volume controller, and controller
      number 39 (0x27) controls the lower 7 bits.
      The value of a 14-bit controller is determined
      by the interaction of the two halves.  When the most significant 7 bits
      of a controller are set (using controller numbers 0 through 31), the
      lower 7 bits are automatically set to 0.  The corresponding controller
      number for the lower 7 bits may then be used to further modulate the
      controller value.
      It is possible that the underlying synthesizer
      does not support a specific controller message. In order
      to verify that a call to <code>controlChange</code>
      was successful, use <code>getController</code>.
      @param controller the controller number (0 to 127; see the MIDI
      1.0 Specification for the interpretation)

      Obtains the current value of the specified controller.  The return
      value is represented with 7 bits. For 14-bit controllers, the MSB and
      LSB controller value needs to be obtained separately. For example,
      the 14-bit value of the volume controller can be calculated by
      multiplying the value of controller 7 (0x07, channel volume MSB)
      with 128 and adding the
      value of controller 39 (0x27, channel volume LSB).

      Turns omni mode on or off.  In omni mode, the channel responds
      to messages sent on all channels.  When omni is off, the channel
      responds only to messages sent on its channel number.
      The default is omni off.
      It is possible that the underlying synthesizer
      does not support omni mode. In order
      to verify that <code>setOmni</code>
      was successful, use <code>getOmni</code>.

      Sets the mute state for this channel. A value of
      <code>true</code> means the channel is to be muted, <code>false</code>

      Unlike {@link #allSoundOff()}, this method
