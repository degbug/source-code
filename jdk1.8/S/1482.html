  Access to date and time using fields and units, and date time adjusters.
  </p>
  <p>
  This package expands on the base package to provide additional functionality for
  more powerful use cases. Support is included for:
  </p>
  <ul><li>Units of date-time, such as years, months, days and hours</li><li>Fields of date-time, such as month-of-year, day-of-week or hour-of-day</li><li>Date-time adjustment functions</li><li>Different definitions of weeks</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Fields and Units</h3>
  <p>
  Dates and times are expressed in terms of fields and units.
  A unit is used to measure an amount of time, such as years, days or minutes.
  All units implement {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit}.
  The set of well known units is defined in {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit}, such as <code>DAYS</code>.
  The unit interface is designed to allow application defined units.
  </p>
  <p>
  A field is used to express part of a larger date-time, such as year, month-of-year or second-of-minute.
  All fields implement {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalField}.
  The set of well known fields are defined in {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoField}, such as <code>HOUR_OF_DAY</code>.
  Additional fields are defined by {@link java.time.temporal.JulianFields}, {@link java.time.temporal.WeekFields}
  and {@link java.time.temporal.IsoFields}.
  The field interface is designed to allow application defined fields.
  </p>
  <p>
  This package provides tools that allow the units and fields of date and time to be accessed
  in a general way most suited for frameworks.
  {@link java.time.temporal.Temporal} provides the abstraction for date time types that support fields.
  Its methods support getting the value of a field, creating a new date time with the value of
  a field modified, and querying for additional information, typically used to extract the offset or time-zone.
  </p>
  <p>
  One use of fields in application code is to retrieve fields for which there is no convenience method.
  For example, getting the day-of-month is common enough that there is a method on <code>LocalDate</code>
  called <code>getDayOfMonth()</code>. However for more unusual fields it is necessary to use the field.
  For example, <code>date.get(ChronoField.ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH)</code>.
  The fields also provide access to the range of valid values.
  </p>
  <h3>Adjustment and Query</h3>
  <p>
  A key part of the date-time problem space is adjusting a date to a new, related value,
  such as the "last day of the month", or "next Wednesday".
  These are modeled as functions that adjust a base date-time.
  The functions implement {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjuster} and operate on <code>Temporal</code>.
  A set of common functions are provided in {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters}.
  For example, to find the first occurrence of a day-of-week after a given date, use
  {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters#next(DayOfWeek)}, such as
  <code>date.with(next(MONDAY))</code>.
  Applications can also define adjusters by implementing {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjuster}.
  </p>
  <p>
  The {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount} interface models amounts of relative time.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition to adjusting a date-time, an interface is provided to enable querying via
  {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalQuery}.
  The most common implementations of the query interface are method references.
  The <code>from(TemporalAccessor)</code> methods on major classes can all be used, such as
  <code>LocalDate::from</code> or <code>Month::from</code>.
  Further implementations are provided in {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalQueries} as static methods.
  Applications can also define queries by implementing {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalQuery}.
  </p>
  <h3>Weeks</h3>
  <p>
  Different locales have different definitions of the week.
  For example, in Europe the week typically starts on a Monday, while in the US it starts on a Sunday.
  The {@link java.time.temporal.WeekFields} class models this distinction.
  </p>
  <p>
  The ISO calendar system defines an additional week-based division of years.
  This defines a year based on whole Monday to Monday weeks.
  This is modeled in {@link java.time.temporal.IsoFields}.
  </p>
  <h3>Package specification</h3>
  <p>
  Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in any class or interface
  in this package will cause a {@link java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown.
  The Javadoc "@param" definition is used to summarise the null-behavior.
  The "@throws {@link java.lang.NullPointerException}" is not explicitly documented in each method.
  </p>
  <p>
  All calculations should check for numeric overflow and throw either an {@link java.lang.ArithmeticException}
  or a {@link java.time.DateTimeException}.
  </p>
