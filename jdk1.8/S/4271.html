  This interface represents a context in which you can perform
  operations with LDAPv3-style controls and perform LDAPv3-style
  extended operations.
  For applications that do not require such controls or extended
  operations, the more generic <tt>javax.naming.directory.DirContext</tt>
  should be used instead.
  <h3>Usage Details About Controls</h3>
  This interface provides support for LDAP v3 controls.
  At a high level, this support allows a user
  program to set request controls for LDAP operations that are executed
  in the course of the user program's invocation of
  <tt>Context</tt>/<tt>DirContext</tt>
  methods, and read response controls resulting from LDAP operations.
  At the implementation level, there are some details that developers of
  both the user program and service providers need to understand in order
  to correctly use request and response controls.
  <h3>Request Controls</h3>
  <p>
  There are two types of request controls:
  </p><ul><li>Request controls that affect how a connection is created
  </li><li>Request controls that affect context methods
  </li></ul>
  The former is used whenever a connection needs to be established or
  re-established with an LDAP server. The latter is used when all other
  LDAP operations are sent to the LDAP server.  The reason why a
  distinction between these two types of request controls is necessary
  is because JNDI is a high-level API that does not deal directly with
  connections.  It is the job of service providers to do any necessary
  connection management. Consequently, a single
  connection may be shared by multiple context instances, and a service provider
  is free to use its own algorithms to conserve connection and network
  usage. Thus, when a method is invoked on the context instance, the service
  provider might need to do some connection management in addition to
  performing the corresponding LDAP operations. For connection management,
  it uses the <em>connection request controls</em>, while for the normal
  LDAP operations, it uses the <em>context request controls</em>.
 <p>Unless explicitly qualified, the term "request controls" refers to
  context request controls.
  </p><h4>Context Request Controls</h4>
  There are two ways in which a context instance gets its request controls:
  <ol>
  <li><tt>ldapContext.newInstance(<strong>reqCtls</strong>)</tt>
  </li><li><tt>ldapContext.setRequestControls(<strong>reqCtls</strong>)</tt>
  </li></ol>
  where <tt>ldapContext</tt> is an instance of <tt>LdapContext</tt>.
  Specifying <tt>null</tt> or an empty array for <tt>reqCtls</tt>
  means no request controls.
  <tt>newInstance()</tt> creates a new instance of a context using
  <tt>reqCtls</tt>, while <tt>setRequestControls()</tt>
  updates an existing context instance's request controls to <tt>reqCtls</tt>.
  <p>
  Unlike environment properties, request controls of a context instance
  <em>are not inherited</em> by context instances that are derived from
  it.  Derived context instances have <tt>null</tt> as their context
  request controls.  You must set the request controls of a derived context
  instance explicitly using <tt>setRequestControls()</tt>.
  </p><p>
  A context instance's request controls are retrieved using
  the method <tt>getRequestControls()</tt>.
  </p><h4>Connection Request Controls</h4>
  There are three ways in which connection request controls are set:
  <ol>
  <li><tt>
  new InitialLdapContext(env, <strong>connCtls</strong>)</tt>
  </li><li><tt>refException.getReferralContext(env, <strong>connCtls</strong>)</tt>
  </li><li><tt>ldapContext.reconnect(<strong>connCtls</strong>);</tt>
  </li></ol>
  where <tt>refException</tt> is an instance of
  <tt>LdapReferralException</tt>, and <tt>ldapContext</tt> is an
  instance of <tt>LdapContext</tt>.
  Specifying <tt>null</tt> or an empty array for <tt>connCtls</tt>
  means no connection request controls.
  <p>
  Like environment properties, connection request controls of a context
  <em>are inherited</em> by contexts that are derived from it.
  Typically, you initialize the connection request controls using the
  <tt>InitialLdapContext</tt> constructor or
  <tt>LdapReferralContext.getReferralContext()</tt>. These connection
  request controls are inherited by contexts that share the same
  connection--that is, contexts derived from the initial or referral
  contexts.
  </p><p>
  Use <tt>reconnect()</tt> to change the connection request controls of
  a context.
  Invoking <tt>ldapContext.reconnect()</tt> affects only the
  connection used by <tt>ldapContext</tt> and any new contexts instances that are
  derived form <tt>ldapContext</tt>. Contexts that previously shared the
  connection with <tt>ldapContext</tt> remain unchanged. That is, a context's
  connection request controls must be explicitly changed and is not
  affected by changes to another context's connection request
  controls.
  </p><p>
  A context instance's connection request controls are retrieved using
  the method <tt>getConnectControls()</tt>.
  </p><h4>Service Provider Requirements</h4>
  A service provider supports connection and context request controls
  in the following ways.  Context request controls must be associated on
  a per context instance basis while connection request controls must be
  associated on a per connection instance basis.  The service provider
  must look for the connection request controls in the environment
  property "java.naming.ldap.control.connect" and pass this environment
  property on to context instances that it creates.
  <h3>Response Controls</h3>
  The method <tt>LdapContext.getResponseControls()</tt> is used to
  retrieve the response controls generated by LDAP operations executed
  as the result of invoking a <tt>Context</tt>/<tt>DirContext</tt>
  operation. The result is all of the responses controls generated
  by the underlying LDAP operations, including any implicit reconnection.
  To get only the reconnection response controls,
  use <tt>reconnect()</tt> followed by <tt>getResponseControls()</tt>.
  <h3>Parameters</h3>
  A <tt>Control[]</tt> array
  passed as a parameter to any method is owned by the caller.
  The service provider will not modify the array or keep a reference to it,
  although it may keep references to the individual <tt>Control</tt> objects
  in the array.
  A <tt>Control[]</tt> array returned by any method is immutable, and may
  not subsequently be modified by either the caller or the service provider.

      Creates a new instance of this context initialized using request controls.
      This method is a convenience method for creating a new instance
      of this context for the purposes of multithreaded access.
      For example, if multiple threads want to use different context
      request controls,
      each thread may use this method to get its own copy of this context
      and set/get context request controls without having to synchronize with other
      threads.

      The new context has the same environment properties and connection
      request controls as this context. See the class description for details.
      Implementations might also allow this context and the new context
      to share the same network connection or other resources if doing
      so does not impede the independence of either context.
      @param requestControls The possibly null request controls

      This method is a way to explicitly initiate an LDAP "bind" operation.
      For example, you can use this method to set request controls for
      the LDAP "bind" operation, or to explicitly connect to the server
      to get response controls returned by the LDAP "bind" operation.
