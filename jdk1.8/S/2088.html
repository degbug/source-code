  This class is for AWT permissions.
  An <code>AWTPermission</code> contains a target name but
  no actions list; you either have the named permission
  or you don't.
  <p>
  The target name is the name of the AWT permission (see below). The naming
  convention follows the hierarchical property naming convention.
  Also, an asterisk could be used to represent all AWT permissions.
  </p><p>
  The following table lists all the possible <code>AWTPermission</code>
  target names, and for each provides a description of what the
  permission allows and a discussion of the risks of granting code
  the permission.
  </p><table border="1" cellpadding="5" summary="AWTPermission target names, descriptions, and associated risks.">
  <tbody><tr>
  <th>Permission Target Name</th>
  <th>What the Permission Allows</th>
  <th>Risks of Allowing this Permission</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>accessClipboard</td>
    <td>Posting and retrieval of information to and from the AWT clipboard</td>
    <td>This would allow malfeasant code to share
  potentially sensitive or confidential information.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>accessEventQueue</td>
    <td>Access to the AWT event queue</td>
    <td>After retrieving the AWT event queue,
  malicious code may peek at and even remove existing events
  from its event queue, as well as post bogus events which may purposefully
  cause the application or applet to misbehave in an insecure manner.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>accessSystemTray</td>
    <td>Access to the AWT SystemTray instance</td>
    <td>This would allow malicious code to add tray icons to the system tray.
  First, such an icon may look like the icon of some known application
  (such as a firewall or anti-virus) and order a user to do something unsafe
  (with help of balloon messages). Second, the system tray may be glutted with
  tray icons so that no one could add a tray icon anymore.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>createRobot</td>
    <td>Create java.awt.Robot objects</td>
    <td>The java.awt.Robot object allows code to generate native-level
  mouse and keyboard events as well as read the screen. It could allow
  malicious code to control the system, run other programs, read the
  display, and deny mouse and keyboard access to the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fullScreenExclusive</td>
    <td>Enter full-screen exclusive mode</td>
    <td>Entering full-screen exclusive mode allows direct access to
  low-level graphics card memory.  This could be used to spoof the
  system, since the program is in direct control of rendering. Depending on
  the implementation, the security warning may not be shown for the windows
  used to enter the full-screen exclusive mode (assuming that the {@code
  fullScreenExclusive} permission has been granted to this application). Note
  that this behavior does not mean that the {@code
  showWindowWithoutWarningBanner} permission will be automatically granted to
  the application which has the <code>fullScreenExclusive</code> permission:
  non-full-screen windows will continue to be shown with the security
  warning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>listenToAllAWTEvents</td>
    <td>Listen to all AWT events, system-wide</td>
    <td>After adding an AWT event listener,
  malicious code may scan all AWT events dispatched in the system,
  allowing it to read all user input (such as passwords).  Each
  AWT event listener is called from within the context of that
  event queue's EventDispatchThread, so if the accessEventQueue
  permission is also enabled, malicious code could modify the
  contents of AWT event queues system-wide, causing the application
  or applet to misbehave in an insecure manner.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>readDisplayPixels</td>
    <td>Readback of pixels from the display screen</td>
    <td>Interfaces such as the java.awt.Composite interface or the
  java.awt.Robot class allow arbitrary code to examine pixels on the
  display enable malicious code to snoop on the activities of the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>replaceKeyboardFocusManager</td>
    <td>Sets the <code>KeyboardFocusManager</code> for
        a particular thread.
    </td><td>When <code>SecurityManager</code> is installed, the invoking
        thread must be granted this permission in order to replace
        the current <code>KeyboardFocusManager</code>.  If permission
        is not granted, a <code>SecurityException</code> will be thrown.
  </td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setAppletStub</td>
    <td>Setting the stub which implements Applet container services</td>
    <td>Malicious code could set an applet's stub and result in unexpected
  behavior or denial of service to an applet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setWindowAlwaysOnTop</td>
    <td>Setting always-on-top property of the window: {@link Window#setAlwaysOnTop}</td>
    <td>The malicious window might make itself look and behave like a real full desktop, so that
  information entered by the unsuspecting user is captured and subsequently misused </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>showWindowWithoutWarningBanner</td>
    <td>Display of a window without also displaying a banner warning
  that the window was created by an applet</td>
    <td>Without this warning,
  an applet may pop up windows without the user knowing that they
  belong to an applet.  Since users may make security-sensitive
  decisions based on whether or not the window belongs to an applet
  (entering a username and password into a dialog box, for example),
  disabling this warning banner may allow applets to trick the user
  into entering such information.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>toolkitModality</td>
    <td>Creating {@link Dialog.ModalityType#TOOLKIT_MODAL TOOLKIT_MODAL} dialogs
        and setting the {@link Dialog.ModalExclusionType#TOOLKIT_EXCLUDE
        TOOLKIT_EXCLUDE} window property.</td>
    <td>When a toolkit-modal dialog is shown from an applet, it blocks all other
  applets in the browser. When launching applications from Java Web Start,
  its windows (such as the security dialog) may also be blocked by toolkit-modal
  dialogs, shown from these applications.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>watchMousePointer</td>
    <td>Getting the information about the mouse pointer position at any
  time</td>
    <td>Constantly watching the mouse pointer,
  an applet can make guesses about what the user is doing, i.e. moving
  the mouse to the lower left corner of the screen most likely means that
  the user is about to launch an application. If a virtual keypad is used
  so that keyboard is emulated using the mouse, an applet may guess what
  is being typed.</td>
