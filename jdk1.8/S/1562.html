  An object that may hold resources (such as file or socket handles)
  until it is closed. The {@link #close()} method of an <code>AutoCloseable</code>
  object is called automatically when exiting a {@code
  try}-with-resources block for which the object has been declared in
  the resource specification header. This construction ensures prompt
  release, avoiding resource exhaustion exceptions and errors that
  may otherwise occur.
  @apiNote
  <p>It is possible, and in fact common, for a base class to
  implement AutoCloseable even though not all of its subclasses or
  instances will hold releasable resources.  For code that must operate
  in complete generality, or when it is known that the <code>AutoCloseable</code>
  instance requires resource release, it is recommended to use {@code
  try}-with-resources constructions. However, when using facilities such as
  {@link java.util.stream.Stream} that support both I/O-based and
  non-I/O-based forms, <code>try</code>-with-resources blocks are in
  general unnecessary when using non-I/O-based forms.

      Closes this resource, relinquishing any underlying resources.
      This method is invoked automatically on objects managed by the
      <code>try</code>-with-resources statement.
      <p>While this interface method is declared to throw {@code
      Exception}, implementers are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to
      declare concrete implementations of the <code>close</code> method to
      throw more specific exceptions, or to throw no exception at all
      if the close operation cannot fail.
      </p><p> Cases where the close operation may fail require careful
      attention by implementers. It is strongly advised to relinquish
      the underlying resources and to internally <em>mark</em> the
      resource as closed, prior to throwing the exception. The {@code
      close} method is unlikely to be invoked more than once and so
      this ensures that the resources are released in a timely manner.
      Furthermore it reduces problems that could arise when the resource
      wraps, or is wrapped, by another resource.
      </p><p><em>Implementers of this interface are also strongly advised
      to not have the <code>close</code> method throw {@link
      InterruptedException}.</em>
      This exception interacts with a thread's interrupted status,
      and runtime misbehavior is likely to occur if an {@code
      InterruptedException} is {@linkplain Throwable#addSuppressed
      suppressed}.
      More generally, if it would cause problems for an
      exception to be suppressed, the <code>AutoCloseable.close</code>
      method should not throw it.
      </p><p>Note that unlike the {@link java.io.Closeable#close close}
      method of {@link java.io.Closeable}, this <code>close</code> method
      is <em>not</em> required to be idempotent.  In other words,
      calling this <code>close</code> method more than once may have some
      visible side effect, unlike <code>Closeable.close</code> which is
      required to have no effect if called more than once.
      However, implementers of this interface are strongly encouraged
      to make their <code>close</code> methods idempotent.
      @throws Exception if this resource cannot be closed</p></div>
