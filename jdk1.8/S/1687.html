<div class="comment">
  The management interface for a memory pool.  A memory pool
  represents the memory resource managed by the Java virtual machine
  and is managed by one or more {@link MemoryManagerMXBean memory managers}.
  <p> A Java virtual machine has one or more instances of the
  implementation class of this interface.  An instance
  implementing this interface is
  an <a href="ManagementFactory.html#MXBean">MXBean</a>
  that can be obtained by calling
  the {@link ManagementFactory#getMemoryPoolMXBeans} method or
  from the {@link ManagementFactory#getPlatformMBeanServer
  platform <tt>MBeanServer</tt>} method.
  </p><p>The <tt>ObjectName</tt> for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
  a memory pool within an <tt>MBeanServer</tt> is:
  </p><blockquote>
     {@link ManagementFactory#MEMORY_POOL_MXBEAN_DOMAIN_TYPE
     <tt>java.lang:type=MemoryPool</tt>}<tt>,name=</tt><i>pool's name</i>
  </blockquote>
  It can be obtained by calling the
  {@link PlatformManagedObject#getObjectName} method.
  <h3>Memory Type</h3>
  <p>The Java virtual machine has a heap for object allocation and also
  maintains non-heap memory for the method area and the Java virtual
  machine execution.  The Java virtual machine can have one or more
  memory pools.  Each memory pool represents a memory area
  of one of the following types:
  </p><ul><li>{@link MemoryType#HEAP heap}</li><li>{@link MemoryType#NON_HEAP non-heap}</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Memory Usage Monitoring</h3>
  A memory pool has the following attributes:
  <ul><li><a href="#Usage">Memory usage</a></li><li><a href="#PeakUsage">Peak memory usage</a></li><li><a href="#UsageThreshold">Usage Threshold</a></li><li><a href="#CollectionThreshold">Collection Usage Threshold</a>
        (only supported by some <em>garbage-collected</em> memory pools)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="Usage">1. Memory Usage</a></h3>
  The <a href="#L409" title="Defined at 409.">getUsage</a> method provides an estimate
  of the current usage of a memory pool.
  For a garbage-collected memory pool, the amount of used memory
  includes the memory occupied by all objects in the pool
  including both <em>reachable</em> and <em>unreachable</em> objects.
  <p>In general, this method is a lightweight operation for getting
  an approximate memory usage.  For some memory pools, for example,
  when objects are not packed contiguously, this method may be
  an expensive operation that requires some computation to determine
  the current memory usage.  An implementation should document when
  this is the case.
  </p><h3><a name="PeakUsage">2. Peak Memory Usage</a></h3>
  The Java virtual machine maintains the peak memory usage of a memory
  pool since the virtual machine was started or the peak was reset.
  The peak memory usage is returned by the <a href="#L427" title="Defined at 427.">getPeakUsage</a> method
  and reset by calling the <a href="#L437" title="Defined at 437.">resetPeakUsage</a> method.
  <h3><a name="UsageThreshold">3. Usage Threshold</a></h3>
  Each memory pool has a manageable attribute
  called the <i>usage threshold</i> which has a default value supplied
  by the Java virtual machine.  The default value is platform-dependent.
  The usage threshold can be set via the
  <a href="#L498" title="Defined at 498.">setUsageThreshold</a> method.
  If the threshold is set to a positive value, the usage threshold crossing
  checking is enabled in this memory pool.
  If the usage threshold is set to zero, usage
  threshold crossing checking on this memory pool is disabled.
  The {@link MemoryPoolMXBean#isUsageThresholdSupported} method can
  be used to determine if this functionality is supported.
  <p>
  A Java virtual machine performs usage threshold crossing checking on a
  memory pool basis at its best appropriate time, typically,
  at garbage collection time.
  Each memory pool maintains a {@link #getUsageThresholdCount
  usage threshold count} that will get incremented
  every time when the Java virtual machine
  detects that the memory pool usage is crossing the threshold.
  </p><p>
  This manageable usage threshold attribute is designed for monitoring the
  increasing trend of memory usage with low overhead.
  Usage threshold may not be appropriate for some memory pools.
  For example, a generational garbage collector, a common garbage collection
  algorithm used in many Java virtual machine implementations,
  manages two or more generations segregating objects by age.
  Most of the objects are allocated in
  the <em>youngest generation</em> (say a nursery memory pool).
  The nursery memory pool is designed to be filled up and
  collecting the nursery memory pool will free most of its memory space
  since it is expected to contain mostly short-lived objects
  and mostly are unreachable at garbage collection time.
  In this case, it is more appropriate for the nursery memory pool
  not to support a usage threshold.  In addition,
  if the cost of an object allocation
  in one memory pool is very low (for example, just atomic pointer exchange),
  the Java virtual machine would probably not support the usage threshold
  for that memory pool since the overhead in comparing the usage with
  the threshold is higher than the cost of object allocation.
  </p><p>
  The memory usage of the system can be monitored using
  <a href="#Polling">polling</a> or
  <a href="#ThresholdNotification">threshold notification</a> mechanisms.
  </p><ol type="a">
    <li><a name="Polling"><b>Polling</b></a>
        <p>
        An application can continuously monitor its memory usage
        by calling either the <a href="#L409" title="Defined at 409.">getUsage</a> method for all
        memory pools or the <a href="#L511" title="Defined at 511.">isUsageThresholdExceeded</a> method
        for those memory pools that support a usage threshold.
        Below is example code that has a thread dedicated for
        task distribution and processing.  At every interval,
        it will determine if it should receive and process new tasks based
        on its memory usage.  If the memory usage exceeds its usage threshold,
        it will redistribute all outstanding tasks to other VMs and
        stop receiving new tasks until the memory usage returns
        below its usage threshold.
        </p><pre>        // Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
        // Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
        // should be taken.
        pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);
        ....
        boolean lowMemory = false;
        while (true) {
           if (pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded()) {
               // potential low memory, so redistribute tasks to other VMs
               lowMemory = true;
               redistributeTasks();
               // stop receiving new tasks
               stopReceivingTasks();
           } else {
               if (lowMemory) {
                   // resume receiving tasks
                   lowMemory = false;
                   resumeReceivingTasks();
               }
               // processing outstanding task
               ...
           }
           // sleep for sometime
           try {
               Thread.sleep(sometime);
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
               ...
           }
        }
        </pre>
  <hr>
        The above example does not differentiate the case where
        the memory usage has temporarily dropped below the usage threshold
        from the case where the memory usage remains above the threshold
        between two iterations.  The usage threshold count returned by
        the <a href="#L523" title="Defined at 523.">getUsageThresholdCount</a> method
        can be used to determine
        if the memory usage has returned below the threshold
        between two polls.
        <p>
        Below shows another example that takes some action if a
        memory pool is under low memory and ignores the memory usage
        changes during the action processing time.
        </p><pre>        // Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
        // Set the threshold to myThreshold which determines if
        // the application will take some action under low memory condition.
        pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);
        int prevCrossingCount = 0;
        while (true) {
            // A busy loop to detect when the memory usage
            // has exceeded the threshold.
            while (!pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded() ||
                   pool.getUsageThresholdCount() == prevCrossingCount) {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(sometime)
                } catch (InterruptException e) {
                    ....
                }
            }
            // Do some processing such as check for memory usage
            // and issue a warning
            ....
            // Gets the current threshold count. The busy loop will then
            // ignore any crossing of threshold happens during the processing.
            prevCrossingCount = pool.getUsageThresholdCount();
        }
        </pre><hr>
    </li><li><a name="ThresholdNotification"><b>Usage Threshold Notifications</b></a>
        <p>
        Usage threshold notification will be emitted by {@link MemoryMXBean}.
        When the Java virtual machine detects that the memory usage of
        a memory pool has reached or exceeded the usage threshold
        the virtual machine will trigger the <tt>MemoryMXBean</tt> to emit an
        {@link MemoryNotificationInfo#MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED
        usage threshold exceeded notification}.
        Another usage threshold exceeded notification will not be
        generated until the usage has fallen below the threshold and
        then exceeded it again.
        </p><p>
        Below is an example code implementing the same logic as the
        first example above but using the usage threshold notification
        mechanism to detect low memory conditions instead of polling.
        In this example code, upon receiving notification, the notification
        listener notifies another thread to perform the actual action
        such as to redistribute outstanding tasks, stop receiving tasks,
        or resume receiving tasks.
        The <tt>handleNotification</tt> method should be designed to
        do a very minimal amount of work and return without delay to avoid
        causing delay in delivering subsequent notifications.  Time-consuming
        actions should be performed by a separate thread.
        The notification listener may be invoked by multiple threads
        concurrently; so the tasks performed by the listener
        should be properly synchronized.
        </p><pre>        class MyListener implements javax.management.NotificationListener {
             public void handleNotification(Notification notification, Object handback)  {
                 String notifType = notification.getType();
                 if (notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED)) {
                     // potential low memory, notify another thread
                     // to redistribute outstanding tasks to other VMs
                     // and stop receiving new tasks.
                     lowMemory = true;
                     notifyAnotherThread(lowMemory);
                 }
             }
        }
        // Register MyListener with MemoryMXBean
        MemoryMXBean mbean = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();
        NotificationEmitter emitter = (NotificationEmitter) mbean;
        MyListener listener = new MyListener();
        emitter.addNotificationListener(listener, null, null);
        // Assume this pool supports a usage threshold.
        // Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
        // should be taken.
        pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);
        // Usage threshold detection is enabled and notification will be
        // handled by MyListener.  Continue for other processing.
        ....
        </pre>
  <hr>
        <p>
        There is no guarantee about when the <tt>MemoryMXBean</tt> will emit
        a threshold notification and when the notification will be delivered.
        When a notification listener is invoked, the memory usage of
        the memory pool may have crossed the usage threshold more
        than once.
        The {@link MemoryNotificationInfo#getCount} method returns the number
        of times that the memory usage has crossed the usage threshold
        at the point in time when the notification was constructed.
        It can be compared with the current usage threshold count returned
        by the <a href="#L523" title="Defined at 523.">getUsageThresholdCount</a> method to determine if
        such situation has occurred.
    </p></li>
  </ol>
  <h3><a name="CollectionThreshold">4. Collection Usage Threshold</a></h3>
  Collection usage threshold is a manageable attribute only applicable
  to some garbage-collected memory pools.
  After a Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming memory
  space by recycling unused objects in a memory pool at garbage collection
  time, some number of bytes in the memory pools that are garbaged
  collected will still be in use.  The collection usage threshold
  allows a value to be set for this number of bytes such
  that if the threshold is exceeded,
  a {@link MemoryNotificationInfo#MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED
  collection usage threshold exceeded notification}
  will be emitted by the {@link MemoryMXBean}.
  In addition, the {@link #getCollectionUsageThresholdCount
  collection usage threshold count} will then be incremented.
  <p>
  The {@link MemoryPoolMXBean#isCollectionUsageThresholdSupported} method can
  be used to determine if this functionality is supported.
  </p><p>
  A Java virtual machine performs collection usage threshold checking
  on a memory pool basis.  This checking is enabled if the collection
  usage threshold is set to a positive value.
  If the collection usage threshold is set to zero, this checking
  is disabled on this memory pool.  Default value is zero.
  The Java virtual machine performs the collection usage threshold
  checking at garbage collection time.
  </p><p>
  Some garbage-collected memory pools may
  choose not to support the collection usage threshold.  For example,
  a memory pool is only managed by a continuous concurrent garbage
  collector.  Objects can be allocated in this memory pool by some thread
  while the unused objects are reclaimed by the concurrent garbage
  collector simultaneously.  Unless there is a well-defined
  garbage collection time which is the best appropriate time
  to check the memory usage, the collection usage threshold should not
  be supported.
  </p><p>
  The collection usage threshold is designed for monitoring the memory usage
  after the Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming
  memory space.  The collection usage could also be monitored
  by the polling and threshold notification mechanism
  described above for the <a href="#UsageThreshold">usage threshold</a>
  in a similar fashion.
