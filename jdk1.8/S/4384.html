  A target data line is a type of <code>{@link DataLine}</code> from which
  audio data can be read.  The most common example is a data line that gets
  its data from an audio capture device.  (The device is implemented as a
  mixer that writes to the target data line.)
  <p>
  Note that the naming convention for this interface reflects the relationship
  between the line and its mixer.  From the perspective of an application,
  a target data line may act as a source for audio data.
  </p><p>
  The target data line can be obtained from a mixer by invoking the
  <code>{@link Mixer#getLine getLine}</code>
  method of <code>Mixer</code> with an appropriate
  <code>{@link DataLine.Info}</code> object.
  </p><p>
  The <code>TargetDataLine</code> interface provides a method for reading the
  captured data from the target data line's buffer.Applications
  that record audio should read data from the target data line quickly enough
  to keep the buffer from overflowing, which could cause discontinuities in
  the captured data that are perceived as clicks.  Applications can use the
  <code>{@link DataLine#available available}</code> method defined in the
  <code>DataLine</code> interface to determine the amount of data currently
  queued in the data line's buffer.  If the buffer does overflow,
  the oldest queued data is discarded and replaced by new data.

      Reads audio data from the data line's input buffer.   The requested
      number of bytes is read into the specified array, starting at
      the specified offset into the array in bytes.  This method blocks until
      the requested amount of data has been read.  However, if the data line
      is closed, stopped, drained, or flushed before the requested amount has
      been read, the method no longer blocks, but returns the number of bytes
      read thus far.
      <p>
      The number of bytes that can be read without blocking can be ascertained
      using the <code>{@link DataLine#available available}</code> method of the
      <code>DataLine</code> interface.  (While it is guaranteed that
      this number of bytes can be read without blocking, there is no guarantee
      that attempts to read additional data will block.)
      </p><p>
      The number of bytes to be read must represent an integral number of
      sample frames, such that:
      <br>
      </p><center><code>[ bytes read ] % [frame size in bytes ] == 0</code></center>
      <br>
      The return value will always meet this requirement.  A request to read a
      number of bytes representing a non-integral number of sample frames cannot
      be fulfilled and may result in an IllegalArgumentException.
      @param b a byte array that will contain the requested input data when
      this method returns
      @param off the offset from the beginning of the array, in bytes
      @param len the requested number of bytes to read
      @return the number of bytes actually read
      @throws IllegalArgumentException if the requested number of bytes does
      not represent an integral number of sample frames.
      or if <code>len</code> is negative.
      @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if <code>off</code> is negative,
      or <code>off+len</code> is greater than the length of the array
      <code>b</code>.
