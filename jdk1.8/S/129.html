  CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters that
  would otherwise be regarded as markup. The only delimiter that is
  recognized in a CDATA section is the "]]&gt;" string that ends the CDATA
  section. CDATA sections cannot be nested. Their primary purpose is for
  including material such as XML fragments, without needing to escape all
  the delimiters.
  <p>The <code>CharacterData.data</code> attribute holds the text that is
  contained by the CDATA section. Note that this <em>may</em> contain characters that need to be escaped outside of CDATA sections and
  that, depending on the character encoding ("charset") chosen for
  serialization, it may be impossible to write out some characters as part
  of a CDATA section.
  </p><p>The <code>CDATASection</code> interface inherits from the
  <code>CharacterData</code> interface through the <code>Text</code>
  interface. Adjacent <code>CDATASection</code> nodes are not merged by use
  of the <code>normalize</code> method of the <code>Node</code> interface.
  </p><p> No lexical check is done on the content of a CDATA section and it is
  therefore possible to have the character sequence <code>"]]&gt;"</code>
  in the content, which is illegal in a CDATA section per section 2.7 of [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204">XML 1.0</a>]. The
  presence of this character sequence must generate a fatal error during
  serialization or the cdata section must be splitted before the
  serialization (see also the parameter <code>"split-cdata-sections"</code>
  in the <code>DOMConfiguration</code> interface).
  </p><p><b>Note:</b> Because no markup is recognized within a
  <code>CDATASection</code>, character numeric references cannot be used as
  an escape mechanism when serializing. Therefore, action needs to be taken
  when serializing a <code>CDATASection</code> with a character encoding
  where some of the contained characters cannot be represented. Failure to
  do so would not produce well-formed XML.
  </p><p><b>Note:</b> One potential solution in the serialization process is to
  end the CDATA section before the character, output the character using a
  character reference or entity reference, and open a new CDATA section for
  any further characters in the text node. Note, however, that some code
  conversion libraries at the time of writing do not return an error or
  exception when a character is missing from the encoding, making the task
  of ensuring that data is not corrupted on serialization more difficult.
