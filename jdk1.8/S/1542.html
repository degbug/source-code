  Enumeration of different ways to resolve dates and times.
  <p>
  Parsing a text string occurs in two phases.
  Phase 1 is a basic text parse according to the fields added to the builder.
  Phase 2 resolves the parsed field-value pairs into date and/or time objects.
  This style is used to control how phase 2, resolving, happens.
  @implSpec
  This is an immutable and thread-safe enum.
  @since 1.8</p></div>

      Style to resolve dates and times strictly.
      <p>
      Using strict resolution will ensure that all parsed values are within
      the outer range of valid values for the field. Individual fields may
      be further processed for strictness.
      </p><p>
      For example, resolving year-month and day-of-month in the ISO calendar
      system using strict mode will ensure that the day-of-month is valid
      for the year-month, rejecting invalid values.</p></div>
<a id="L90" name="L90"></a>  90     STRICT,
<div class="comment">
      Style to resolve dates and times in a smart, or intelligent, manner.
      <p>
      Using smart resolution will perform the sensible default for each
      field, which may be the same as strict, the same as lenient, or a third
      behavior. Individual fields will interpret this differently.
      </p><p>
      For example, resolving year-month and day-of-month in the ISO calendar
      system using smart mode will ensure that the day-of-month is from
      1 to 31, converting any value beyond the last valid day-of-month to be
      the last valid day-of-month.</p></div>

<div class="comment">
      Style to resolve dates and times leniently.
      <p>
      Using lenient resolution will resolve the values in an appropriate
      lenient manner. Individual fields will interpret this differently.
      </p><p>
      For example, lenient mode allows the month in the ISO calendar system
      to be outside the range 1 to 12.
      For example, month 15 is treated as being 3 months after month 12.</p></div>
