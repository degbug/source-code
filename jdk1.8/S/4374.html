  The <code>AudioPermission</code> class represents access rights to the audio
  system resources.  An <code>AudioPermission</code> contains a target name
  but no actions list; you either have the named permission or you don't.
  <p>
  The target name is the name of the audio permission (see the table below).
  The names follow the hierarchical property-naming convention. Also, an asterisk
  can be used to represent all the audio permissions.

  The following table lists the possible <code>AudioPermission</code> target names.
  For each name, the table provides a description of exactly what that permission
  allows, as well as a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission.

  audio playback (rendering).</td>
