  A KeyEventDispatcher cooperates with the current KeyboardFocusManager in the
  targeting and dispatching of all KeyEvents. KeyEventDispatchers registered
  with the current KeyboardFocusManager will receive KeyEvents before they are
  dispatched to their targets, allowing each KeyEventDispatcher to retarget
  the event, consume it, dispatch the event itself, or make other changes.
  <p>
  Note that KeyboardFocusManager itself implements KeyEventDispatcher. By
  default, the current KeyboardFocusManager will be the sink for all KeyEvents
  not dispatched by the registered KeyEventDispatchers. The current
  KeyboardFocusManager cannot be completely deregistered as a
  KeyEventDispatcher. However, if a KeyEventDispatcher reports that it
  dispatched the KeyEvent, regardless of whether it actually did so, the
  KeyboardFocusManager will take no further action with regard to the
  KeyEvent. (While it is possible for client code to register the current
  KeyboardFocusManager as a KeyEventDispatcher one or more times, this is
  usually unnecessary and not recommended.)

      This method is called by the current KeyboardFocusManager requesting
      that this KeyEventDispatcher dispatch the specified event on its behalf.
      This KeyEventDispatcher is free to retarget the event, consume it,
      dispatch it itself, or make other changes. This capability is typically
      used to deliver KeyEvents to Components other than the focus owner. This
      can be useful when navigating children of non-focusable Windows in an
      accessible environment, for example. Note that if a KeyEventDispatcher
      dispatches the KeyEvent itself, it must use <code>redispatchEvent</code>
      to prevent the current KeyboardFocusManager from recursively requesting
      that this KeyEventDispatcher dispatch the event again.
      <p>
      If an implementation of this method returns <code>false</code>, then
      the KeyEvent is passed to the next KeyEventDispatcher in the chain,
      ending with the current KeyboardFocusManager. If an implementation
      returns <code>true</code>, the KeyEvent is assumed to have been
      dispatched (although this need not be the case), and the current
      KeyboardFocusManager will take no further action with regard to the
      KeyEvent. In such a case,
      <code>KeyboardFocusManager.dispatchEvent</code> should return
      <code>true</code> as well. If an implementation consumes the KeyEvent,
      but returns <code>false</code>, the consumed event will still be passed
      to the next KeyEventDispatcher in the chain. It is important for
      developers to check whether the KeyEvent has been consumed before
      dispatching it to a target. By default, the current KeyboardFocusManager
      will not dispatch a consumed KeyEvent.
      @param e the KeyEvent to dispatch
      @return <code>true</code> if the KeyboardFocusManager should take no
              further action with regard to the KeyEvent; <code>false</code>
              otherwise
