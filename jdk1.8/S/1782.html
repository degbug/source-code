  Provides classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java
  programming language. The most important classes are {@code
  Object}, which is the root of the class hierarchy, and {@code
  Class}, instances of which represent classes at run time.
  <p>Frequently it is necessary to represent a value of primitive
  type as if it were an object. The wrapper classes <code>Boolean</code>,
  <code>Character</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Long</code>, <code>Float</code>,
  and <code>Double</code> serve this purpose.  An object of type {@code
  Double}, for example, contains a field whose type is double,
  representing that value in such a way that a reference to it can be
  stored in a variable of reference type.  These classes also provide
  a number of methods for converting among primitive values, as well
  as supporting such standard methods as equals and hashCode.  The
  <code>Void</code> class is a non-instantiable class that holds a
  reference to a <code>Class</code> object representing the type void.
  </p><p>The class <code>Math</code> provides commonly used mathematical
  functions such as sine, cosine, and square root. The classes {@code
  String}, <code>StringBuffer</code>, and <code>StringBuilder</code> similarly
  provide commonly used operations on character strings.
  </p><p>Classes <code>ClassLoader</code>, <code>Process</code>, {@code
  ProcessBuilder}, <code>Runtime</code>, <code>SecurityManager</code>, and
  <code>System</code> provide "system operations" that manage the dynamic
  loading of classes, creation of external processes, host
  environment inquiries such as the time of day, and enforcement of
  security policies.
  </p><p>Class <code>Throwable</code> encompasses objects that may be thrown
  by the <code>throw</code> statement. Subclasses of <code>Throwable</code>
  represent errors and exceptions.

  </p><h3>Character Encodings</h3>
  The specification of the {@link java.nio.charset.Charset
  java.nio.charset.Charset} class describes the naming conventions
  for character encodings as well as the set of standard encodings
  that must be supported by every implementation of the Java
  platform.
