  The interface for an annotation processor.
  <p>Annotation processing happens in a sequence of {@linkplain
  javax.annotation.processing.RoundEnvironment rounds}.  On each
  round, a processor may be asked to {@linkplain #process process} a
  subset of the annotations found on the source and class files
  produced by a prior round.  The inputs to the first round of
  processing are the initial inputs to a run of the tool; these
  initial inputs can be regarded as the output of a virtual zeroth
  round of processing.  If a processor was asked to process on a
  given round, it will be asked to process on subsequent rounds,
  including the last round, even if there are no annotations for it
  to process.  The tool infrastructure may also ask a processor to
  process files generated implicitly by the tool's operation.
  </p><p> Each implementation of a <code>Processor</code> must provide a
  public no-argument constructor to be used by tools to instantiate
  the processor.  The tool infrastructure will interact with classes
  implementing this interface as follows:
  </p><ol>
  <li>If an existing <code>Processor</code> object is not being used, to
  create an instance of a processor the tool calls the no-arg
  constructor of the processor class.
  </li><li>Next, the tool calls the <a href="#L286" title="Defined at 286.">init</a> method with
  an appropriate <code>ProcessingEnvironment</code>.
  </li><li>Afterwards, the tool calls {@link #getSupportedAnnotationTypes
  getSupportedAnnotationTypes}, {@link #getSupportedOptions
  getSupportedOptions}, and {@link #getSupportedSourceVersion
  getSupportedSourceVersion}.  These methods are only called once per
  run, not on each round.
  </li><li>As appropriate, the tool calls the <a href="#L307" title="Defined at 307.">process</a>
  method on the <code>Processor</code> object; a new <code>Processor</code>
  object is <em>not</em> created for each round.
  </li></ol>
  If a processor object is created and used without the above
  protocol being followed, then the processor's behavior is not
  defined by this interface specification.
  <p> The tool uses a <i>discovery process</i> to find annotation
  processors and decide whether or not they should be run.  By
  configuring the tool, the set of potential processors can be
  controlled.  For example, for a {@link javax.tools.JavaCompiler
  JavaCompiler} the list of candidate processors to run can be
  {@linkplain javax.tools.JavaCompiler.CompilationTask#setProcessors
  set directly} or controlled by a {@linkplain
  javax.tools.StandardLocation#ANNOTATION_PROCESSOR_PATH search path}
  used for a {@linkplain java.util.ServiceLoader service-style}
  lookup.  Other tool implementations may have different
  configuration mechanisms, such as command line options; for
  details, refer to the particular tool's documentation.  Which
  processors the tool asks to {@linkplain #process run} is a function
  of the types of the annotations <em>{@linkplain AnnotatedConstruct present}</em>
  on the {@linkplain
  RoundEnvironment#getRootElements root elements}, what {@linkplain
  #getSupportedAnnotationTypes annotation types a processor
  supports}, and whether or not a processor {@linkplain #process
  claims the annotation types it processes}.  A processor will be asked to
  process a subset of the annotation types it supports, possibly an
  empty set.
  For a given round, the tool computes the set of annotation types
  that are present on the elements enclosed within the root elements.
  If there is at least one annotation type present, then as
  processors claim annotation types, they are removed from the set of
  unmatched annotation types.  When the set is empty or no more
  processors are available, the round has run to completion.  If
  there are no annotation types present, annotation processing still
  occurs but only <i>universal processors</i> which support
  processing all annotation types, <code>"*"</code>, can claim the (empty)
  set of annotation types.
  </p><p>An annotation type is considered present if there is at least
  one annotation of that type present on an element enclosed within
  the root elements of a round. For this purpose, a type parameter is
  considered to be enclosed by its {@linkplain
  TypeParameterElement#getGenericElement generic
  element}. Annotations on {@linkplain
  java.lang.annotation.ElementType#TYPE_USE type uses}, as opposed to
  annotations on elements, are ignored when computing whether or not
  an annotation type is present.
  </p><p>An annotation is present if it meets the definition of being
  present given in {@link AnnotatedConstruct}. In brief, an
  annotation is considered present for the purposes of discovery if
  it is directly present or present via inheritance. An annotation is
  <em>not</em> considered present by virtue of being wrapped by a
  container annotation. Operationally, this is equivalent to an
  annotation being present on an element if and only if it would be
  included in the results of {@link
  Elements#getAllAnnotationMirrors(Element)} called on that element. Since
  annotations inside container annotations are not considered
  present, to properly process {@linkplain
  java.lang.annotation.Repeatable repeatable annotation types},
  processors are advised to include both the repeatable annotation
  type and its containing annotation type in the set of {@linkplain
  #getSupportedAnnotationTypes() supported annotation types} of a
  processor.
  </p><p>Note that if a processor supports <code>"*"</code> and returns {@code
  true}, all annotations are claimed.  Therefore, a universal
  processor being used to, for example, implement additional validity
  checks should return <code>false</code> so as to not prevent other such
  checkers from being able to run.
  </p><p>If a processor throws an uncaught exception, the tool may cease
  other active annotation processors.  If a processor raises an
  error, the current round will run to completion and the subsequent
  round will indicate an {@linkplain RoundEnvironment#errorRaised
  error was raised}.  Since annotation processors are run in a
  cooperative environment, a processor should throw an uncaught
  exception only in situations where no error recovery or reporting
  is feasible.
  </p><p>The tool environment is not required to support annotation
  processors that access environmental resources, either {@linkplain
  RoundEnvironment per round} or {@linkplain ProcessingEnvironment
  cross-round}, in a multi-threaded fashion.
  </p><p>If the methods that return configuration information about the
  annotation processor return <code>null</code>, return other invalid
  input, or throw an exception, the tool infrastructure must treat
  this as an error condition.
  </p><p>To be robust when running in different tool implementations, an
  annotation processor should have the following properties:
  </p><ol>
  <li>The result of processing a given input is not a function of the presence or absence
  of other inputs (orthogonality).
  </li><li>Processing the same input produces the same output (consistency).
  </li><li>Processing input <i>A</i> followed by processing input <i>B</i>
  is equivalent to processing <i>B</i> then <i>A</i>
  (commutativity)
  </li><li>Processing an input does not rely on the presence of the output
  of other annotation processors (independence)
  </li></ol>
  <p>The {@link Filer} interface discusses restrictions on how
  processors can operate on files.
  </p><p>Note that implementors of this interface may find it convenient
  to extend {@link AbstractProcessor} rather than implementing this
  interface directly.

     Returns to the tool infrastructure an iterable of suggested
     completions to an annotation.  Since completions are being asked
     for, the information provided about the annotation may be
     incomplete, as if for a source code fragment. A processor may
     return an empty iterable.  Annotation processors should focus
     their efforts on providing completions for annotation members
     with additional validity constraints known to the processor, for
     example an <code>int</code> member whose value should lie between 1
     and 10 or a string member that should be recognized by a known
     grammar, such as a regular expression or a URL.
     <p>Since incomplete programs are being modeled, some of the
     parameters may only have partial information or may be {@code
     null}.  At least one of <code>element</code> and <code>userText</code>
     must be non-<code>null</code>.  If <code>element</code> is non-{@code
     null}, <code>annotation</code> and <code>member</code> may be {@code
     null}.  Processors may not throw a <code>NullPointerException</code>
     if some parameters are <code>null</code>; if a processor has no
     completions to offer based on the provided information, an
     empty iterable can be returned.  The processor may also return
     a single completion with an empty value string and a message
     describing why there are no completions.
     </p><p>Completions are informative and may reflect additional
     validity checks performed by annotation processors.  For
     example, consider the simple annotation:
     </p><blockquote>
     <pre>     @MersennePrime {
        int value();
     }
     </pre>
     </blockquote>
     (A Mersenne prime is prime number of the form
     2<sup><i>n</i></sup> - 1.) Given an <code>AnnotationMirror</code>
     for this annotation type, a list of all such primes in the
     <code>int</code> range could be returned without examining any other
     arguments to <code>getCompletions</code>:
     <blockquote>
     <pre>     import static javax.annotation.processing.Completions.*;
     ...
     return Arrays.asList({@link Completions#of(String) of}("3"),
                          of("7"),
                          of("31"),
                          of("127"),
                          of("8191"),
                          of("131071"),
                          of("524287"),
                          of("2147483647"));
     </pre>
     </blockquote>
     A more informative set of completions would include the number
     of each prime:
     <blockquote>
     <pre>     return Arrays.asList({@link Completions#of(String, String) of}("3",          "M2"),
                          of("7",          "M3"),
                          of("31",         "M5"),
                          of("127",        "M7"),
                          of("8191",       "M13"),
                          of("131071",     "M17"),
                          of("524287",     "M19"),
                          of("2147483647", "M31"));
     </pre>
     </blockquote>
     However, if the <code>userText</code> is available, it can be checked
     to see if only a subset of the Mersenne primes are valid.  For
     example, if the user has typed
     <blockquote>
     <code>
     @MersennePrime(1
     </code>
     </blockquote>
     the value of <code>userText</code> will be <code>"1"</code>; and only
     two of the primes are possible completions:
     <blockquote>
     <pre>     return Arrays.asList(of("127",        "M7"),
                          of("131071",     "M17"));
     </pre>
     </blockquote>
     Sometimes no valid completion is possible.  For example, there
     is no in-range Mersenne prime starting with 9:
     <blockquote>
     <code>
     @MersennePrime(9
     </code>
     </blockquote>
     An appropriate response in this case is to either return an
     empty list of completions,
     <blockquote>
     <pre>     return Collections.emptyList();
     </pre>
     </blockquote>
     or a single empty completion with a helpful message
     <blockquote>
     <pre>     return Arrays.asList(of("", "No in-range Mersenne primes start with 9"));
     </pre>
     </blockquote>
