  This is the super class of all the locale sensitive service provider
  interfaces (SPIs).
  </p><p>
  Locale sensitive  service provider interfaces are interfaces that
  correspond to locale sensitive classes in the <code>java.text</code>
  and <code>java.util</code> packages. The interfaces enable the
  construction of locale sensitive objects and the retrieval of
  localized names for these packages. Locale sensitive factory methods
  and methods for name retrieval in the <code>java.text</code> and
  <code>java.util</code> packages use implementations of the provider
  interfaces to offer support for locales beyond the set of locales
  supported by the Java runtime environment itself.
  </p><h3>Packaging of Locale Sensitive Service Provider Implementations</h3>
  Implementations of these locale sensitive services are packaged using the
  <a href="../../../../technotes/guides/extensions/index.html">Java Extension Mechanism</a>
  as installed extensions.  A provider identifies itself with a
  provider-configuration file in the resource directory META-INF/services,
  using the fully qualified provider interface class name as the file name.
  The file should contain a list of fully-qualified concrete provider class names,
  one per line. A line is terminated by any one of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage
  return ('\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed. Space
  and tab characters surrounding each name, as well as blank lines, are ignored.
  The comment character is '#' ('\u0023'); on each line all characters following
  the first comment character are ignored. The file must be encoded in UTF-8.
  <p>
  If a particular concrete provider class is named in more than one configuration
  file, or is named in the same configuration file more than once, then the
  duplicates will be ignored. The configuration file naming a particular provider
  need not be in the same jar file or other distribution unit as the provider itself.
  The provider must be accessible from the same class loader that was initially
  queried to locate the configuration file; this is not necessarily the class loader
  that loaded the file.
  </p><p>
  For example, an implementation of the
  {@link java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider DateFormatProvider} class should
  take the form of a jar file which contains the file:
  </p><pre>  META-INF/services/java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider
  </pre>
  And the file <code>java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider</code> should have
  a line such as:
  <pre>  <code>com.foo.DateFormatProviderImpl</code>
  </pre>
  which is the fully qualified class name of the class implementing
  <code>DateFormatProvider</code>.
  <h4>Invocation of Locale Sensitive Services</h4>
  <p>
  Locale sensitive factory methods and methods for name retrieval in the
  <code>java.text</code> and <code>java.util</code> packages invoke
  service provider methods when needed to support the requested locale.
  The methods first check whether the Java runtime environment itself
  supports the requested locale, and use its support if available.
  Otherwise, they call the {@link #isSupportedLocale(Locale) isSupportedLocale}
  methods of installed providers for the appropriate interface to find one that
  supports the requested locale. If such a provider is found, its other
  methods are called to obtain the requested object or name.  When checking
  whether a locale is supported, the <a href="../Locale.html#def_extensions">
  locale's extensions</a> are ignored by default. (If locale's extensions should
  also be checked, the <code>isSupportedLocale</code> method must be overridden.)
  If neither the Java runtime environment itself nor an installed provider
  supports the requested locale, the methods go through a list of candidate
  locales and repeat the availability check for each until a match is found.
  The algorithm used for creating a list of candidate locales is same as
  the one used by <code>ResourceBundle</code> by default (see
  {@link java.util.ResourceBundle.Control#getCandidateLocales getCandidateLocales}
  for the details).  Even if a locale is resolved from the candidate list,
  methods that return requested objects or names are invoked with the original
  requested locale including <code>Locale</code> extensions. The Java runtime
  environment must support the root locale for all locale sensitive services in
  order to guarantee that this process terminates.
  </p><p>
  Providers of names (but not providers of other objects) are allowed to
  return null for some name requests even for locales that they claim to
  support by including them in their return value for
  <code>getAvailableLocales</code>. Similarly, the Java runtime
  environment itself may not have all names for all locales that it
  supports. This is because the sets of objects for which names are
  requested can be large and vary over time, so that it's not always
  feasible to cover them completely. If the Java runtime environment or a
  provider returns null instead of a name, the lookup will proceed as
  described above as if the locale was not supported.
  </p><p>
  Starting from JDK8, the search order of locale sensitive services can
  be configured by using the "java.locale.providers" system property.
  This system property declares the user's preferred order for looking up
  the locale sensitive services separated by a comma. It is only read at
  the Java runtime startup, so the later call to System.setProperty() won't
  affect the order.
  </p><p>
  For example, if the following is specified in the property:
  </p><pre>  java.locale.providers=SPI,JRE
  </pre>
  where "SPI" represents the locale sensitive services implemented in the
  installed SPI providers, and "JRE" represents the locale sensitive services
  in the Java Runtime Environment, the locale sensitive services in the SPI
  providers are looked up first.
  <p>
  There are two other possible locale sensitive service providers, i.e., "CLDR"
  which is a provider based on Unicode Consortium's
  <a href="http://cldr.unicode.org/">CLDR Project</a>, and "HOST" which is a
  provider that reflects the user's custom settings in the underlying operating
  system. These two providers may not be available, depending on the Java Runtime
  Environment implementation. Specifying "JRE,SPI" is identical to the default
  behavior, which is compatibile with the prior releases.

      Returns <code>true</code> if the given <code>locale</code> is supported by
      this locale service provider. The given <code>locale</code> may contain
      <a href="../Locale.html#def_extensions">extensions</a> that should be

      <p>The default implementation returns <code>true</code> if the given <code>locale</code>
      is equal to any of the available <code>Locale</code>s returned by
      {@link #getAvailableLocales()} with ignoring any extensions in both the
      given <code>locale</code> and the available locales. Concrete locale service
      provider implementations should override this method if those
      implementations are <code>Locale</code> extensions-aware. For example,
      <code>DecimalFormatSymbolsProvider</code> implementations will need to check
      extensions in the given <code>locale</code> to see if any numbering system is
      specified and can be supported. However, <code>CollatorProvider</code>
      implementations may not be affected by any particular numbering systems,
      and in that case, extensions for numbering systems should be ignored.
