  Framework-level interface defining an amount of time, such as
  "6 hours", "8 days" or "2 years and 3 months".
  <p>
  This is the base interface type for amounts of time.
  An amount is distinct from a date or time-of-day in that it is not tied
  to any specific point on the time-line.
  </p><p>
  The amount can be thought of as a <code>Map</code> of <a href="../S/1473.html#L97" title="Defined at 97 in src/java/time/temporal/TemporalUnit.java.">TemporalUnit</a> to
  <code>long</code>, exposed via {@link #getUnits()} and {@link #get(TemporalUnit)}.
  A simple case might have a single unit-value pair, such as "6 hours".
  A more complex case may have multiple unit-value pairs, such as
  "7 years, 3 months and 5 days".
  </p><p>
  There are two common implementations.
  {@link Period} is a date-based implementation, storing years, months and days.
  {@link Duration} is a time-based implementation, storing seconds and nanoseconds,
  but providing some access using other duration based units such as minutes,
  hours and fixed 24-hour days.
  </p><p>
  This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
  used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
  around instances of concrete types, such as <code>Period</code> and <code>Duration</code>.
  @implSpec
  This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
  however immutability is strongly recommended.
  @since 1.8</p></div>

      Returns the value of the requested unit.
      The units returned from {@link #getUnits()} uniquely define the
      value of the <code>TemporalAmount</code>.  A value must be returned
      for each unit listed in <code>getUnits</code>.
      @implSpec
      Implementations may declare support for units not listed by {@link #getUnits()}.
      Typically, the implementation would define additional units
      as conversions for the convenience of developers.
      @param unit the <code>TemporalUnit</code> for which to return the value
      @return the long value of the unit
      @throws DateTimeException if a value for the unit cannot be obtained

      Returns the list of units uniquely defining the value of this TemporalAmount.
      The list of <code>TemporalUnits</code> is defined by the implementation class.
      The list is a snapshot of the units at the time <code>getUnits</code>
      is called and is not mutable.
      The units are ordered from longest duration to the shortest duration
      of the unit.
      @implSpec
      The list of units completely and uniquely represents the
      state of the object without omissions, overlaps or duplication.
      The units are in order from longest duration to shortest.
      @return the List of <code>TemporalUnits</code>; not null</div>

      Adds to the specified temporal object.
      <p>
      Adds the amount to the specified temporal object using the logic
      encapsulated in the implementing class.
      </p><p>
      There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
      The first is to invoke this method directly.
      The second is to use {@link Temporal#plus(TemporalAmount)}:
      </p><pre>        // These two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
        dateTime = amount.addTo(dateTime);
        dateTime = dateTime.plus(adder);
      </pre>
      It is recommended to use the second approach, <code>plus(TemporalAmount)</code>,
      as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
      @implSpec
      The implementation must take the input object and add to it.
      The implementation defines the logic of the addition and is responsible for
      documenting that logic. It may use any method on <code>Temporal</code> to
      query the temporal object and perform the addition.
      The returned object must have the same observable type as the input object
      <p>
      The input object must not be altered.
      Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
      This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable temporal objects.
      </p><p>
      The input temporal object may be in a calendar system other than ISO.
      Implementations may choose to document compatibility with other calendar systems,
      or reject non-ISO temporal objects by {@link TemporalQueries#chronology() querying the chronology}.
      </p><p>
      This method may be called from multiple threads in parallel.
      It must be thread-safe when invoked.

      @return an object of the same observable type with the addition made, not null
