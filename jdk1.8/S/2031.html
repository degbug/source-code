  An asynchronous channel for reading, writing, and manipulating a file.
  <p> An asynchronous file channel is created when a file is opened by invoking
  one of the <a href="#L241" title="Defined at 241.">open</a> methods defined by this class. The file contains
  a variable-length sequence of bytes that can be read and written and whose
  current size can be {@link #size() queried}. The size of the file increases
  when bytes are written beyond its  current size; the size of the file decreases
  when it is <a href="#L341" title="Defined at 341.">truncate</a>.
  </p><p> An asynchronous file channel does not have a <i>current position</i>
  within the file. Instead, the file position is specified to each read and
  write method that initiates asynchronous operations. A <a href="../S/2033.html#L45" title="Defined at 45 in src/java/nio/channels/CompletionHandler.java.">CompletionHandler</a>
  is specified as a parameter and is invoked to consume the result of the I/O
  operation. This class also defines read and write methods that initiate
  asynchronous operations, returning a <a href="../D/3465.html" title="Multiple defined in 2 places.">Future</a> to represent the pending
  result of the operation. The <code>Future</code> may be used to check if the
  operation has completed, wait for its completion, and retrieve the result.
  </p><p> In addition to read and write operations, this class defines the
  following operations: </p>
  <ul><li><p> Updates made to a file may be {@link #force <i>forced
    out</i>} to the underlying storage device, ensuring that data are not
    lost in the event of a system crash.  </p></li><li><p> A region of a file may be <a href="#L457" title="Defined at 457.">lock</a> against
    access by other programs.  </p></li>
  </ul>
  <p> An <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> is associated with a thread pool to
  which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch to completion
  handlers that consume the results of I/O operations on the channel. The
  completion handler for an I/O operation initiated on a channel is guaranteed
  to be invoked by one of the threads in the thread pool (This ensures that the
  completion handler is run by a thread with the expected <em>identity</em>).
  Where an I/O operation completes immediately, and the initiating thread is
  itself a thread in the thread pool, then the completion handler may be invoked
  directly by the initiating thread. When an <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> is
  created without specifying a thread pool then the channel is associated with
  a system-dependent default thread pool that may be shared with other
  channels. The default thread pool is configured by the system properties
  defined by the {@link AsynchronousChannelGroup} class.
  </p><p> Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The
  {@link Channel#close close} method may be invoked at any time, as specified
  by the {@link Channel} interface. This causes all outstanding asynchronous
  operations on the channel to complete with the exception {@link
  AsynchronousCloseException}. Multiple read and write operations may be
  outstanding at the same time. When multiple read and write operations are
  outstanding then the ordering of the I/O operations, and the order that the
  completion handlers are invoked, is not specified; they are not, in particular,
  guaranteed to execute in the order that the operations were initiated. The
  {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer ByteBuffers} used when reading or writing are not
  safe for use by multiple concurrent I/O operations. Furthermore, after an I/O
  operation is initiated then care should be taken to ensure that the buffer is
  not accessed until after the operation has completed.
  </p><p> As with {@link FileChannel}, the view of a file provided by an instance of
  this class is guaranteed to be consistent with other views of the same file
  provided by other instances in the same program.  The view provided by an
  instance of this class may or may not, however, be consistent with the views
  seen by other concurrently-running programs due to caching performed by the
  underlying operating system and delays induced by network-filesystem protocols.
  This is true regardless of the language in which these other programs are
  written, and whether they are running on the same machine or on some other
  machine.  The exact nature of any such inconsistencies are system-dependent
  and are therefore unspecified.

      which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch completion
      results for operations initiated on resulting channel.
      The nature of these tasks is highly implementation specific and so care
      should be taken when configuring the <code>Executor</code>. Minimally it
      should support an unbounded work queue and should not run tasks on the
      caller thread of the {@link ExecutorService#execute execute} method.

      Forces any updates to this channel's file to be written to the storage
      device that contains it.
      <p> If this channel's file resides on a local storage device then when
      this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file
      since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked,
      will have been written to that device.  This is useful for ensuring that
      critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash.
      </p><p> If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
      is made.
      </p><p> The <code>metaData</code> parameter can be used to limit the number of
      I/O operations that this method is required to perform.  Passing
      <code>false</code> for this parameter indicates that only updates to the
      file's content need be written to storage; passing <code>true</code>
      indicates that updates to both the file's content and metadata must be
      written, which generally requires at least one more I/O operation.
      Whether this parameter actually has any effect is dependent upon the
      underlying operating system and is therefore unspecified.
      </p><p> Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the
      channel was only opened for reading.  Some operating systems, for
      example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file's metadata, and
      this time is updated whenever the file is read.  Whether or not this is
      actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified.

      this channel's file via the methods defined in this class.

      Acquires a lock on the given region of this channel's file.
      <p> This method initiates an operation to acquire a lock on the given
      region of this channel's file. The <code>handler</code> parameter is a
      completion handler that is invoked when the lock is acquired (or the
      operation fails). The result passed to the completion handler is the
      resulting <code>FileLock</code>.
      </p><p> The region specified by the <code>position</code> and <code>size</code>
      parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual
      underlying file.  Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region
      initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the
      region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock.
      If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is
      required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the
      expected maximum size of the file, should be locked.  The two-argument
      {@link #lock(Object,CompletionHandler)} method simply locks a region
      of size {@link Long#MAX_VALUE}. If a lock that overlaps the requested
      region is already held by this Java virtual machine, or this method has
      been invoked to lock an overlapping region and that operation has not
      completed, then this method throws {@link OverlappingFileLockException}.
      </p><p> Some operating systems do not support a mechanism to acquire a file
      lock in an asynchronous manner. Consequently an implementation may
      acquire the file lock in a background thread or from a task executed by
      a thread in the associated thread pool. If there are many lock operations
      outstanding then it may consume threads in the Java virtual machine for
      indefinite periods.
      </p><p> Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a
      request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for
      an exclusive lock.  Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or
      exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's {@link
      FileLock#isShared() isShared} method.
      </p><p> File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
      They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
      threads within the same virtual machine.
