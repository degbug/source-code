  <code>Lock</code> implementations provide more extensive locking
  operations than can be obtained using <code>synchronized</code> methods
  and statements.  They allow more flexible structuring, may have
  quite different properties, and may support multiple associated
  {@link Condition} objects.
  <p>A lock is a tool for controlling access to a shared resource by
  multiple threads. Commonly, a lock provides exclusive access to a
  shared resource: only one thread at a time can acquire the lock and
  all access to the shared resource requires that the lock be
  acquired first. However, some locks may allow concurrent access to
  a shared resource, such as the read lock of a {@link ReadWriteLock}.
  </p><p>The use of <code>synchronized</code> methods or statements provides
  access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but
  forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way:
  when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite
  order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which
  they were acquired.
  </p><p>While the scoping mechanism for <code>synchronized</code> methods
  and statements makes it much easier to program with monitor locks,
  and helps avoid many common programming errors involving locks,
  there are occasions where you need to work with locks in a more
  flexible way. For example, some algorithms for traversing
  concurrently accessed data structures require the use of
  "hand-over-hand" or "chain locking": you
  acquire the lock of node A, then node B, then release A and acquire
  C, then release B and acquire D and so on.  Implementations of the
  <code>Lock</code> interface enable the use of such techniques by
  allowing a lock to be acquired and released in different scopes,
  and allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released in any
  order.
  </p><p>With this increased flexibility comes additional
  responsibility. The absence of block-structured locking removes the
  automatic release of locks that occurs with <code>synchronized</code>
  methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom
  should be used:
   </p><pre> {@code
  Lock l = ...;
  l.lock();
  try {
    // access the resource protected by this lock
  } finally {
    l.unlock();
  }}</pre>
  When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be
  taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is
  held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the
  lock is released when necessary.
  <p><code>Lock</code> implementations provide additional functionality
  over the use of <code>synchronized</code> methods and statements by
  providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock ({@link
  #tryLock()}), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be
  interrupted ({@link #lockInterruptibly}, and an attempt to acquire
  the lock that can timeout ({@link #tryLock(long, TimeUnit)}).
  </p><p>A <code>Lock</code> class can also provide behavior and semantics
  that is quite different from that of the implicit monitor lock,
  such as guaranteed ordering, non-reentrant usage, or deadlock
  detection. If an implementation provides such specialized semantics
  then the implementation must document those semantics.
  </p><p>Note that <code>Lock</code> instances are just normal objects and can
  themselves be used as the target in a <code>synchronized</code> statement.
  Acquiring the
  monitor lock of a <code>Lock</code> instance has no specified relationship
  with invoking any of the {@link #lock} methods of that instance.
  It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use <code>Lock</code>
  instances in this way, except within their own implementation.
  </p><p>Except where noted, passing a <code>null</code> value for any
  parameter will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being
  thrown.
  </p><h3>Memory Synchronization</h3>
  <p>All <code>Lock</code> implementations <em>must</em> enforce the same
  memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor
  lock, as described in
  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4">
  The Java Language Specification (17.4 Memory Model)</a>:
  </p><ul><li>A successful <code>lock</code> operation has the same memory
  synchronization effects as a successful <em>Lock</em> action.
  </li><li>A successful <code>unlock</code> operation has the same
  memory synchronization effects as a successful <em>Unlock</em> action.
  </li></ul>
  Unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant
  locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory
  synchronization effects.
  <h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>
  <p>The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible,
  non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their performance
  characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other implementation
  qualities.  Further, the ability to interrupt the <em>ongoing</em>
  acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given <code>Lock</code>
  class.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define
  exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of
  lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an
  ongoing lock acquisition.  An implementation is required to clearly
  document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
  locking methods. It must also obey the interruption semantics as
  defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock
  acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on
  method entry.
  </p><p>As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
  interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
  to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
  shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked
  the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.
