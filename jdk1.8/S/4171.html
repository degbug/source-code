  Interfaces used to model elements of the Java programming language.
  The term "element" in this package is used to refer to program
  elements, the declared entities that make up a program.  Elements
  include classes, interfaces, methods, constructors, and fields.
  The interfaces in this package do not model the structure of a
  program inside a method body; for example there is no
  representation of a <code>for</code> loop or <code>try</code>-<code>finally</code>
  block.  However, the interfaces can model some structures only
  appearing inside method bodies, such as local variables and
  anonymous classes.
  <p>When used in the context of annotation processing, an accurate
  model of the element being represented must be returned.  As this
  is a language model, the source code provides the fiducial
  (reference) representation of the construct in question rather than
  a representation in an executable output like a class file.
  Executable output may serve as the basis for creating a modeling
  element.  However, the process of translating source code to
  executable output may not permit recovering some aspects of the
  source code representation.  For example, annotations with
  {@linkplain java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy#SOURCE source}
  {@linkplain java.lang.annotation.Retention retention} cannot be
  recovered from class files and class files might not be able to
  provide source position information.
  Names of parameters may not be recoverable from class files.
  The {@linkplain javax.lang.model.element.Modifier modifiers} on an
  element may differ in some cases including:
  </p><ul><li> <code>strictfp</code> on a class or interface
  </li><li> <code>final</code> on a parameter
  </li><li> <code>protected</code>, <code>private</code>, and <code>static</code> on classes and interfaces
  </li></ul>
  Additionally, synthetic constructs in a class file, such as
  accessor methods used in implementing nested classes and bridge
  methods used in implementing covariant returns, are translation
  artifacts outside of this model.
  <p>During annotation processing, operating on incomplete or
  erroneous programs is necessary; however, there are fewer
  guarantees about the nature of the resulting model.  If the source
  code is not syntactically well-formed or has some other
  irrecoverable error that could not be removed by the generation of
  new types, a model may or may not be provided as a quality of
  implementation issue.
  If a program is syntactically valid but erroneous in some other
  fashion, any returned model must have no less information than if
  all the method bodies in the program were replaced by {@code "throw
  new RuntimeException();"}.  If a program refers to a missing type XYZ,
  the returned model must contain no less information than if the
  declaration of type XYZ were assumed to be <code>"class XYZ {</code>"},
  <code>"interface XYZ {</code>"}, <code>"enum XYZ {</code>"}, or {@code
  "@interface XYZ {}"}. If a program refers to a missing type {@code
  XYZ<k1, ... ,kn>}, the returned model must contain no less
  information than if the declaration of XYZ were assumed to be
  <code>"class XYZ<t1, ... ,tn> {</t1,></code>"} or {@code "interface XYZ<t1, ... ,tn> {}"}
  </t1,></k1,></p><p> Unless otherwise specified in a particular implementation, the
  collections returned by methods in this package should be expected
  to be unmodifiable by the caller and unsafe for concurrent access.
  </p><p> Unless otherwise specified, methods in this package will throw
  a <code>NullPointerException</code> if given a <code>null</code> argument.
