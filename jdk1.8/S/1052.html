  Interfaces and classes providing a framework for locking and waiting
  for conditions that is distinct from built-in synchronization and
  monitors.  The framework permits much greater flexibility in the use of
  locks and conditions, at the expense of more awkward syntax.
  <p>The {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock} interface supports
  locking disciplines that differ in semantics (reentrant, fair, etc),
  and that can be used in non-block-structured contexts including
  hand-over-hand and lock reordering algorithms.  The main implementation
  is {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock}.
  </p><p>The {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock} interface
  similarly defines locks that may be shared among readers but are
  exclusive to writers.  Only a single implementation, {@link
  java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock}, is provided, since
  it covers most standard usage contexts.  But programmers may create
  their own implementations to cover nonstandard requirements.
  </p><p>The {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition} interface
  describes condition variables that may be associated with Locks.
  These are similar in usage to the implicit monitors accessed using
  <code>Object.wait</code>, but offer extended capabilities.
  In particular, multiple <code>Condition</code> objects may be associated
  with a single <code>Lock</code>.  To avoid compatibility issues, the
  names of <code>Condition</code> methods are different from the
  corresponding <code>Object</code> versions.
  </p><p>The {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer}
  class serves as a useful superclass for defining locks and other
  synchronizers that rely on queuing blocked threads.  The {@link
  java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer} class
  provides the same functionality but extends support to 64 bits of
  synchronization state.  Both extend class {@link
  java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractOwnableSynchronizer}, a simple
  class that helps record the thread currently holding exclusive
  synchronization.  The {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport}
  class provides lower-level blocking and unblocking support that is
  useful for those developers implementing their own customized lock
  classes.
