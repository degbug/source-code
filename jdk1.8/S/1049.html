  <code>Condition</code> factors out the <code>Object</code> monitor
  methods ({@link Object#wait() wait}, {@link Object#notify notify}
  and {@link Object#notifyAll notifyAll}) into distinct objects to
  give the effect of having multiple wait-sets per object, by
  combining them with the use of arbitrary {@link Lock} implementations.
  Where a <code>Lock</code> replaces the use of <code>synchronized</code> methods
  and statements, a <code>Condition</code> replaces the use of the Object
  monitor methods.
  <p>Conditions (also known as <em>condition queues</em> or
  <em>condition variables</em>) provide a means for one thread to
  suspend execution (to "wait") until notified by another
  thread that some state condition may now be true.  Because access
  to this shared state information occurs in different threads, it
  must be protected, so a lock of some form is associated with the
  condition. The key property that waiting for a condition provides
  is that it <em>atomically</em> releases the associated lock and
  suspends the current thread, just like <code>Object.wait</code>.
  </p><p>A <code>Condition</code> instance is intrinsically bound to a lock.
  To obtain a <code>Condition</code> instance for a particular {@link Lock}
  instance use its {@link Lock#newCondition newCondition()} method.
  </p><p>As an example, suppose we have a bounded buffer which supports
  <code>put</code> and <code>take</code> methods.  If a
  <code>take</code> is attempted on an empty buffer, then the thread will block
  until an item becomes available; if a <code>put</code> is attempted on a
  full buffer, then the thread will block until a space becomes available.
  We would like to keep waiting <code>put</code> threads and <code>take</code>
  threads in separate wait-sets so that we can use the optimization of
  only notifying a single thread at a time when items or spaces become
  available in the buffer. This can be achieved using two
  <a href="../R/1638.html" title="Multiple referred from 37 places.">Condition</a> instances.

  (The {@link java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue} class provides
  this functionality, so there is no reason to implement this
  sample usage class.)
  <p>A <code>Condition</code> implementation can provide behavior and semantics
  that is
  different from that of the <code>Object</code> monitor methods, such as
  guaranteed ordering for notifications, or not requiring a lock to be held
  when performing notifications.
  If an implementation provides such specialized semantics then the
  implementation must document those semantics.
  </p><p>Note that <code>Condition</code> instances are just normal objects and can
  themselves be used as the target in a <code>synchronized</code> statement,
  and can have their own monitor {@link Object#wait wait} and
  {@link Object#notify notification} methods invoked.
  Acquiring the monitor lock of a <code>Condition</code> instance, or using its
  monitor methods, has no specified relationship with acquiring the
  {@link Lock} associated with that <code>Condition</code> or the use of its
  {@linkplain #await waiting} and {@linkplain #signal signalling} methods.
  It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use <code>Condition</code>
  instances in this way, except perhaps within their own implementation.
  </p><p>Except where noted, passing a <code>null</code> value for any parameter
  will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being thrown.
  </p><h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>
  <p>When waiting upon a <code>Condition</code>, a "<em>spurious
  wakeup</em>" is permitted to occur, in
  general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics.
  This has little practical impact on most application programs as a
  <code>Condition</code> should always be waited upon in a loop, testing
  the state predicate that is being waited for.  An implementation is
  free to remove the possibility of spurious wakeups but it is
  recommended that applications programmers always assume that they can
  occur and so always wait in a loop.
  </p><p>The three forms of condition waiting
  (interruptible, non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their ease of
  implementation on some platforms and in their performance characteristics.
  In particular, it may be difficult to provide these features and maintain
  specific semantics such as ordering guarantees.
  Further, the ability to interrupt the actual suspension of the thread may
  not always be feasible to implement on all platforms.
  </p><p>Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the
  same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of waiting, nor is it
  required to support interruption of the actual suspension of the thread.
  </p><p>An implementation is required to
  clearly document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
  waiting methods, and when an implementation does support interruption of
  thread suspension then it must obey the interruption semantics as defined
  in this interface.
  </p><p>As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
  interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
  to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
  shown that the interrupt occurred after another action that may have
  unblocked the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

      <p>The method returns an estimate of the number of nanoseconds
      remaining to wait given the supplied <code>nanosTimeout</code>
      value upon return, or a value less than or equal to zero if it
      timed out. This value can be used to determine whether and how
      long to re-wait in cases where the wait returns but an awaited
      condition still does not hold. Typical uses of this method take
      the following form:
       </p><pre> {@code
      boolean aMethod(long timeout, TimeUnit unit) {
        long nanos = unit.toNanos(timeout);

      <p>Design note: This method requires a nanosecond argument so
      as to avoid truncation errors in reporting remaining times.
      Such precision loss would make it difficult for programmers to
      ensure that total waiting times are not systematically shorter
      than specified when re-waits occur.
