  Extended interface for mapping external entity references to input
  sources, or providing a missing external subset.  The
  {@link XMLReader#setEntityResolver XMLReader.setEntityResolver()} method
  is used to provide implementations of this interface to parsers.
  When a parser uses the methods in this interface, the
  {@link EntityResolver2#resolveEntity EntityResolver2.resolveEntity()}
  method (in this interface) is used <em>instead of</em> the older (SAX 1.0)
  {@link EntityResolver#resolveEntity EntityResolver.resolveEntity()} method.
  <blockquote>
  <em>This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
  Public Domain, and comes with <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>.</em>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If a SAX application requires the customized handling which this
  interface defines for external entities, it must ensure that it uses
  an XMLReader with the
  <em>http://xml.org/sax/features/use-entity-resolver2</em> feature flag
  set to <em>true</em> (which is its default value when the feature is
  recognized).  If that flag is unrecognized, or its value is false,
  or the resolver does not implement this interface, then only the
  <a href="../S/722.html#L93" title="Defined at 93 in src/org/xml/sax/EntityResolver.java.">EntityResolver</a> method will be used.
  </p>
  <p>That supports three categories of application that modify entity
  resolution.  <em>Old Style</em> applications won't know about this interface;
  they will provide an EntityResolver.
  <em>Transitional Mode</em> provide an EntityResolver2 and automatically
  get the benefit of its methods in any systems (parsers or other tools)
  supporting it, due to polymorphism.
  Both <em>Old Style</em> and <em>Transitional Mode</em> applications will
  work with any SAX2 parser.
  <em>New style</em> applications will fail to run except on SAX2 parsers
  that support this particular feature.
  They will insist that feature flag have a value of "true", and the
  EntityResolver2 implementation they provide  might throw an exception
  if the original SAX 1.0 style entity resolution method is invoked.

      Allows applications to provide an external subset for documents
      that don't explicitly define one.  Documents with DOCTYPE declarations
      that omit an external subset can thus augment the declarations
      available for validation, entity processing, and attribute processing
      (normalization, defaulting, and reporting types including ID).
      This augmentation is reported
      through the {@link LexicalHandler#startDTD startDTD()} method as if
      the document text had originally included the external subset;
      this callback is made before any internal subset data or errors
      are reported.<p></p>
      <p>This method can also be used with documents that have no DOCTYPE
      declaration.  When the root element is encountered,
      but no DOCTYPE declaration has been seen, this method is
      invoked.  If it returns a value for the external subset, that root
      element is declared to be the root element, giving the effect of
      splicing a DOCTYPE declaration at the end the prolog of a document
      that could not otherwise be valid.  The sequence of parser callbacks
      in that case logically resembles this:</p>
      <pre>      ... comments and PIs from the prolog (as usual)
      startDTD ("rootName", source.getPublicId (), source.getSystemId ());
      startEntity ("[dtd]");
      ... declarations, comments, and PIs from the external subset
      endEntity ("[dtd]");
      endDTD ();
      ... then the rest of the document (as usual)
      startElement (..., "rootName", ...);
      </pre>
      <p>Note that the InputSource gets no further resolution.
      Implementations of this method may wish to invoke
      <a href="#L215" title="Defined at 215.">resolveEntity</a> to gain benefits such as use
      of local caches of DTD entities.  Also, this method will never be
      used by a (non-validating) processor that is not including external
      parameter entities. </p>
      <p>Uses for this method include facilitating data validation when
      interoperating with XML processors that would always require
      undesirable network accesses for external entities, or which for
      other reasons adopt a "no DTDs" policy.
      Non-validation motives include forcing documents to include DTDs so
      that attributes are handled consistently.
      For example, an XPath processor needs to know which attibutes have
      type "ID" before it can process a widely used type of reference.</p>
      <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Returning an external subset modifies
      the input document.  By providing definitions for general entities,
      it can make a malformed document appear to be well formed.
      </p>
      @param name Identifies the document root element.  This name comes
       from a DOCTYPE declaration (where available) or from the actual
       root element.
      @param baseURI The document's base URI, serving as an additional
       hint for selecting the external subset.  This is always an absolute
       URI, unless it is null because the XMLReader was given an InputSource
       without one.
      @return An InputSource object describing the new external subset
       to be used by the parser, or null to indicate that no external
       subset is provided.
      @exception SAXException Any SAX exception, possibly wrapping
       another exception.
      @exception IOException Probably indicating a failure to create
       a new InputStream or Reader, or an illegal URL.</div>

<div class="comment">
      Allows applications to map references to external entities into input
      sources, or tell the parser it should use conventional URI resolution.
      This method is only called for external entities which have been
      properly declared.
      This method provides more flexibility than the <a href="../S/722.html#L93" title="Defined at 93 in src/org/xml/sax/EntityResolver.java.">EntityResolver</a>
      interface, supporting implementations of more complex catalogue
      schemes such as the one defined by the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec-2001-08-06.html">OASIS XML Catalogs</a> specification.<p></p>
      <p>Parsers configured to use this resolver method will call it
      to determine the input source to use for any external entity
      being included because of a reference in the XML text.
      That excludes the document entity, and any external entity returned
      by <a href="#L158" title="Defined at 158.">getExternalSubset</a>.
      When a (non-validating) processor is configured not to include
      a class of entities (parameter or general) through use of feature
      flags, this method is not invoked for such entities.  </p>
      <p>Note that the entity naming scheme used here is the same one
      used in the {@link LexicalHandler}, or in the {@link
        org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#skippedEntity
        ContentHandler.skippedEntity()}
      method. </p>
      @param name Identifies the external entity being resolved.
       Either "[dtd]" for the external subset, or a name starting
       with "%" to indicate a parameter entity, or else the name of
       a general entity.  This is never null when invoked by a SAX2
       parser.
      @param publicId The public identifier of the external entity being
       referenced (normalized as required by the XML specification), or
       null if none was supplied.
      @param baseURI The URI with respect to which relative systemIDs
       are interpreted.  This is always an absolute URI, unless it is
       null (likely because the XMLReader was given an InputSource without
       one).  This URI is defined by the XML specification to be the one
       associated with the "&lt;" starting the relevant declaration.
      @param systemId The system identifier of the external entity
       being referenced; either a relative or absolute URI.
       This is never null when invoked by a SAX2 parser; only declared
       entities, and any external subset, are resolved by such parsers.
      @return An InputSource object describing the new input source to
       be used by the parser.  Returning null directs the parser to
       resolve the system ID against the base URI and open a connection
       to resulting URI.
      @exception SAXException Any SAX exception, possibly wrapping
       another exception.
      @exception IOException Probably indicating a failure to create
       a new InputStream or Reader, or an illegal URL.</div>
