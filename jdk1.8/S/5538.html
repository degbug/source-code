  Set up error messages.
  We build a two dimensional array of message keys and
  message strings. In order to add a new message here,
  you need to first add a String constant. And you need
  to enter key, value pair as part of the contents
  array. You also need to update MAX_CODE for error strings
  and MAX_WARNING for warnings ( Needed for only information
  purpose )</div>
