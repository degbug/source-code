  A helper interface to run the nested event loop.
  <p>
  Objects that implement this interface are created with the
  {@link EventQueue#createSecondaryLoop} method. The interface
  provides two methods, <a href="#L122" title="Defined at 122.">enter</a> and <a href="#L145" title="Defined at 145.">exit</a>,
  which can be used to start and stop the event loop.
  </p><p>
  When the <a href="#L122" title="Defined at 122.">enter</a> method is called, the current
  thread is blocked until the loop is terminated by the
  <a href="#L145" title="Defined at 145.">exit</a> method. Also, a new event loop is started
  on the event dispatch thread, which may or may not be
  the current thread. The loop can be terminated on any
  thread by calling its <a href="#L145" title="Defined at 145.">exit</a> method. After the
  loop is terminated, the <code>SecondaryLoop</code> object can
  be reused to run a new nested event loop.
  </p><p>
  A typical use case of applying this interface is AWT
  and Swing modal dialogs. When a modal dialog is shown on
  the event dispatch thread, it enters a new secondary loop.
  Later, when the dialog is hidden or disposed, it exits
  the loop, and the thread continues its execution.
  </p><p>
  The following example illustrates a simple use case of
  secondary loops:
  </p><pre>    SecondaryLoop loop;
    JButton jButton = new JButton("Button");
    jButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
        <code>@Override</code>
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            Toolkit tk = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
            EventQueue eq = tk.getSystemEventQueue();
            loop = eq.createSecondaryLoop();
            // Spawn a new thread to do the work
            Thread worker = new WorkerThread();
            worker.start();
            // Enter the loop to block the current event
            // handler, but leave UI responsive
            if (!loop.enter()) {
                // Report an error
            }
        }
    });
    class WorkerThread extends Thread {
        <code>@Override</code>
        public void run() {
            // Perform calculations
            doSomethingUseful();
            // Exit the loop
            loop.exit();
        }
    }
  </pre>

      Blocks the execution of the current thread and enters a new
      secondary event loop on the event dispatch thread.
      <p>
      This method can be called by any thread including the event
      dispatch thread. This thread will be blocked until the {@link
      #exit} method is called or the loop is terminated. A new
      secondary loop will be created on the event dispatch thread
      for dispatching events in either case.
      </p><p>
      This method can only start one new event loop at a time per
      object. If a secondary event loop has already been started
      by this object and is currently still running, this method
      returns <code>false</code> to indicate that it was not successful
      in starting a new event loop. Otherwise, this method blocks
      the calling thread and later returns <code>true</code> when the
      new event loop is terminated. At such time, this object can
      again be used to start another new event loop.
      @return <code>true</code> after termination of the secondary loop,
              if the secondary loop was started by this call,
              <code>false</code> otherwise</p></div>

      Unblocks the execution of the thread blocked by the {@link
      #enter} method and exits the secondary loop.
      <p>
      This method resumes the thread that called the <a href="#L122" title="Defined at 122.">enter</a>
      method and exits the secondary loop that was created when
      the <a href="#L122" title="Defined at 122.">enter</a> method was invoked.
      </p><p>
      Note that if any other secondary loop is started while this
      loop is running, the blocked thread will not resume execution
      until the nested loop is terminated.
      </p><p>
      If this secondary loop has not been started with the {@link
      #enter} method, or this secondary loop has already finished
      with the <a href="#L145" title="Defined at 145.">exit</a> method, this method returns {@code
      false}, otherwise <code>true</code> is returned.
      @return <code>true</code> if this loop was previously started and
              has not yet been finished with the <a href="#L145" title="Defined at 145.">exit</a> method,
              <code>false</code> otherwise</p></div>
