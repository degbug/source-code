  A token representing the registration of a <a href="../S/1878.html#L45" title="Defined at 45 in src/java/nio/file/Watchable.java.">Watchable</a> object
  with a {@link WatchService}.
  <p> A watch key is created when a watchable object is registered with a watch
  service. The key remains <a href="#L94" title="Defined at 94.">isValid</a> until:
  </p><ol>
    <li> It is cancelled, explicitly, by invoking its <a href="#L133" title="Defined at 133.">cancel</a>
      method, or</li><li> Cancelled implicitly, because the object is no longer accessible,
      or </li><li> By {@link WatchService#close closing} the watch service. </li>
  </ol>
  <p> A watch key has a state. When initially created the key is said to be
  <em>ready</em>. When an event is detected then the key is <em>signalled</em>
  and queued so that it can be retrieved by invoking the watch service's {@link
  WatchService#poll() poll} or {@link WatchService#take() take} methods. Once
  signalled, a key remains in this state until its <a href="#L120" title="Defined at 120.">reset</a> method
  is invoked to return the key to the ready state. Events detected while the
  key is in the signalled state are queued but do not cause the key to be
  re-queued for retrieval from the watch service. Events are retrieved by
  invoking the key's <a href="#L104" title="Defined at 104.">pollEvents</a> method. This method
  retrieves and removes all events accumulated for the object. When initially
  created, a watch key has no pending events. Typically events are retrieved
  when the key is in the signalled state leading to the following idiom:
  </p><pre>      for (;;) {
          // retrieve key
          WatchKey key = watcher.take();
          // process events
          for (WatchEvent&lt;?&gt; event: key.pollEvents()) {
              :
          }
          // reset the key
          boolean valid = key.reset();
          if (!valid) {
              // object no longer registered
          }
      }
  </pre>
  <p> Watch keys are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. Where there
  are several threads retrieving signalled keys from a watch service then care
  should be taken to ensure that the <code>reset</code> method is only invoked after
  the events for the object have been processed. This ensures that one thread
  is processing the events for an object at any time.

      Cancels the registration with the watch service. Upon return the watch key
      will be invalid. If the watch key is enqueued, waiting to be retrieved
      from the watch service, then it will remain in the queue until it is
      removed. Pending events, if any, remain pending and may be retrieved by
      invoking the <a href="#L104" title="Defined at 104.">pollEvents</a> method after the key is
      cancelled.
      <p> If this watch key has already been cancelled then invoking this

      Returns the object for which this watch key was created. This method will
      continue to return the object even after the key is cancelled.
      <p> As the <code>WatchService</code> is intended to map directly on to the
      native file event notification facility (where available) then many of
      details on how registered objects are watched is highly implementation
      specific. When watching a directory for changes for example, and the
      directory is moved or renamed in the file system, there is no guarantee
      that the watch key will be cancelled and so the object returned by this
      method may no longer be a valid path to the directory.
      @return the object for which this watch key was created</p></div>
