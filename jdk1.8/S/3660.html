  This interface is used by a printing application to cancel a
  print job.  This interface extends <a href="../S/3658.html#L42" title="Defined at 42 in src/javax/print/DocPrintJob.java.">DocPrintJob</a>.  A
  <code>DocPrintJob</code> implementation returned from a print
  service implements this interface if the print job can be
  cancelled.  Before trying to cancel
  a print job, the client needs to test if the
  <code>DocPrintJob</code> object returned from the print service
  actually implements this interface.  Clients should never assume
  that a <code>DocPrintJob</code> implements this interface.  A
  print service might support cancellation only for certain types
  of print data and representation class names.  This means that
  only some of the <code>DocPrintJob</code> objects returned from
  a service will implement this interface.
  <p>
  Service implementors are encouraged to implement this optional interface
  and to deliver a javax.print.event.PrintJobEvent.JOB_CANCELLED event
  to any listeners if a job is successfully cancelled with an
  implementation of this interface. Services should also note that an
  implementation of this method may be made from a separate client thread
  than that which made the print request.  Thus the implementation of
  this interface must be made thread safe.</p></div>

      Stops further processing of a print job.
      <p>
      If a service supports this method it cannot be concluded that
      job cancellation will always succeed. A job may not be able to be
      cancelled once it has reached and passed some point in its processing.
      A successful cancellation means only that the entire job was not
      printed, some portion may already have printed when cancel returns.
      </p><p>
      The service will throw a PrintException if the cancellation did not
      succeed. A job which has not yet been submitted for printing should
      throw this exception.
      Cancelling an already successfully cancelled Print Job is not
      considered an error and will always succeed.
      </p><p>
      Cancellation in some services may be a lengthy process, involving
      requests to a server and processing of its print queue. Clients
      may wish to execute cancel in a thread which does not affect
      application execution.
      @throws PrintException if the job could not be successfully cancelled.</p></div>
