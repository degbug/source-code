  <p>Interface implemented by an MBean that emits Notifications. It
  allows a listener to be registered with the MBean as a notification
  listener.</p>
  <h3>Notification dispatch</h3>
 <p>When an MBean emits a notification, it considers each listener that has been
  added with {@link #addNotificationListener addNotificationListener} and not
  subsequently removed with {@link #removeNotificationListener removeNotificationListener}.
  If a filter was provided with that listener, and if the filter's
  {@link NotificationFilter#isNotificationEnabled isNotificationEnabled} method returns
  false, the listener is ignored.  Otherwise, the listener's
  {@link NotificationListener#handleNotification handleNotification} method is called with
  the notification, as well as the handback object that was provided to
  <code>addNotificationListener</code>.</p>
  <p>If the same listener is added more than once, it is considered as many times as it was
  added.  It is often useful to add the same listener with different filters or handback
  objects.</p>
  <p>Implementations of this interface can differ regarding the thread in which the methods
  of filters and listeners are called.</p>
  <p>If the method call of a filter or listener throws an {@link Exception}, then that
  exception should not prevent other listeners from being invoked.  However, if the method
  call throws an {@link Error}, then it is recommended that processing of the notification
  stop at that point, and if it is possible to propagate the <code>Error</code> to the sender of
  the notification, this should be done.</p>
  <p>This interface should be used by new code in preference to the
  {@link NotificationBroadcaster} interface.</p>
  <p>Implementations of this interface and of <code>NotificationBroadcaster</code>
  should be careful about synchronization.  In particular, it is not a good
  idea for an implementation to hold any locks while it is calling a
  listener.  To deal with the possibility that the list of listeners might
  change while a notification is being dispatched, a good strategy is to
  use a {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList} for this list.

      <p>Removes a listener from this MBean.  The MBean must have a
      listener that exactly matches the given <code>listener</code>,
      <code>filter</code>, and <code>handback</code> parameters.  If
      there is more than one such listener, only one is removed.</p>
      <p>The <code>filter</code> and <code>handback</code> parameters
      may be null if and only if they are null in a listener to be
      removed.</p>
      @param listener A listener that was previously added to this
      MBean.
      @param filter The filter that was specified when the listener
      was added.
      @param handback The handback that was specified when the listener was
      added.
      @exception ListenerNotFoundException The listener is not
      registered with the MBean, or it is not registered with the
      given filter and handback.</div>
