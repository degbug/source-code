  Interface MultiDoc specifies the interface for an object that supplies more
  than one piece of print data for a Print Job. "Doc" is a short,
  easy-to-pronounce term that means "a piece of print data," and a "multidoc"
  is a group of several docs. The client passes to the Print Job an object
  that implements interface MultiDoc, and the Print Job calls methods on
   that object to obtain the print data.
  <p>
  Interface MultiDoc provides an abstraction similar to a "linked list" of
  docs. A multidoc object is like a node in the linked list, containing the
  current doc in the list and a pointer to the next node (multidoc) in the
  list. The Print Job can call the multidoc's {@link #getDoc()
  getDoc()} method to get the current doc. When it's ready to go
  on to the next doc, the Print Job can call the multidoc's {@link #next()
  next()} method to get the next multidoc, which contains the
  next doc. So Print Job code for accessing a multidoc might look like this:
  </p><pre>       void processMultiDoc(MultiDoc theMultiDoc) {
           MultiDoc current = theMultiDoc;
           while (current != null) {
               processDoc (current.getDoc());
               current = current.next();
           }
       }
  </pre>
  <p>
  Of course, interface MultiDoc can be implemented in any way that fulfills
  the contract; it doesn't have to use a linked list in the implementation.
  </p><p>
  To get all the print data for a multidoc print job, a Print Service
  proxy could use either of two patterns:
  </p><ol type="1">
  <li>
  The <b>interleaved</b> pattern: Get the doc from the current multidoc. Get
  the print data representation object from the current doc. Get all the print
  data from the print data representation object. Get the next multidoc from
  the current multidoc, and repeat until there are no more. (The code example
  above uses the interleaved pattern.)
  <p>
  </p></li><li>
  The <b>all-at-once</b> pattern: Get the doc from the current multidoc, and
  save the doc in a list. Get the next multidoc from the current multidoc, and
  repeat until there are no more. Then iterate over the list of saved docs. Get
  the print data representation object from the current doc. Get all the print
  data from the print data representation object. Go to the next doc in the
  list, and repeat until there are no more.
  </li></ol>
  Now, consider a printing client that is generating print data on the fly and
  does not have the resources to store more than one piece of print data at a
  time. If the print service proxy used the all-at-once pattern to get the
  print data, it would pose a problem for such a client; the client would have
  to keep all the docs' print data around until the print service proxy comes
  back and asks for them, which the client is not able to do. To work with such
  a client, the print service proxy must use the interleaved pattern.
  <p>
  To address this problem, and to simplify the design of clients providing
 multiple docs to a Print Job, every Print Service proxy that supports
  multidoc print jobs is required to access a MultiDoc object using the
  interleaved pattern. That is, given a MultiDoc object, the print service
  proxy will call {@link #getDoc() getDoc()} one or more times
  until it successfully obtains the current Doc object. The print service proxy
  will then obtain the current doc's print data, not proceeding until all the
  print data is obtained or an unrecoverable error occurs. If it is able to
  continue, the print service proxy will then call {@link #next()
  next()} one or more times until it successfully obtains either
  the next MultiDoc object or an indication that there are no more. An
  implementation of interface MultiDoc can assume the print service proxy will
  follow this interleaved pattern; for any other pattern of usage, the MultiDoc
  implementation's behavior is unspecified.
  </p><p>
  There is no restriction on the number of client threads that may be
  simultaneously accessing the same multidoc. Therefore, all implementations of
  interface MultiDoc must be designed to be multiple thread safe. In fact, a
  client thread could be adding docs to the end of the (conceptual) list while
  a Print Job thread is simultaneously obtaining docs from the beginning of the
  list; provided the multidoc object synchronizes the threads properly, the two
  threads will not interfere with each other</p></div>
