  The <tt>JAXBContext</tt> class provides the client's entry point to the
  JAXB API. It provides an abstraction for managing the XML/Java binding
  information necessary to implement the JAXB binding framework operations:
  unmarshal, marshal and validate.
  </p><p>A client application normally obtains new instances of this class using
  one of these two styles for newInstance methods, although there are other
  specialized forms of the method available:
  </p><ul><li>{@link #newInstance(String,ClassLoader) JAXBContext.newInstance( "com.acme.foo:com.acme.bar" )} <br>
    The JAXBContext instance is initialized from a list of colon
    separated Java package names. Each java package contains
    JAXB mapped classes, schema-derived classes and/or user annotated
    classes. Additionally, the java package may contain JAXB package annotations
    that must be processed. (see JLS, Section 7.4.1 "Named Packages").
    </li><li>{@link #newInstance(Class...) JAXBContext.newInstance( com.acme.foo.Foo.class )} <br>
     The JAXBContext instance is initialized with class(es)
     passed as parameter(s) and classes that are statically reachable from
     these class(es). See {@link #newInstance(Class...)} for details.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <i><b>SPEC REQUIREMENT:</b> the provider must supply an implementation
  class containing the following method signatures:</i>
  </p><pre>  public static JAXBContext createContext( String contextPath, ClassLoader classLoader, Map&lt;String,Object&gt; properties ) throws JAXBException
  public static JAXBContext createContext( Class[] classes, Map&lt;String,Object&gt; properties ) throws JAXBException
  </pre>
  <p><i>
  The following JAXB 1.0 requirement is only required for schema to
  java interface/implementation binding. It does not apply to JAXB annotated
  classes. JAXB Providers must generate a <tt>jaxb.properties</tt> file in
  each package containing schema derived classes.  The property file must
  contain a property named <tt>javax.xml.bind.context.factory</tt> whose
  value is the name of the class that implements the <tt>createContext</tt>
  APIs.</i>
  </p><p><i>
  The class supplied by the provider does not have to be assignable to
  <tt>javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext</tt>, it simply has to provide a class that
  implements the <tt>createContext</tt> APIs.</i>
  </p><p><i>
  In addition, the provider must call the
  {@link DatatypeConverter#setDatatypeConverter(DatatypeConverterInterface)
  DatatypeConverter.setDatatypeConverter} api prior to any client
  invocations of the marshal and unmarshal methods.  This is necessary to
  configure the datatype converter that will be used during these operations.</i>
  <a name="Unmarshalling"></a>
  </p><h3>Unmarshalling</h3>
  <p>
  The <a href="../S/3943.html#L409" title="Defined at 409 in src/javax/xml/bind/Unmarshaller.java.">Unmarshaller</a> class provides the client application the ability
  to convert XML data into a tree of Java content objects.
  The unmarshal method allows for
  any global XML element declared in the schema to be unmarshalled as
  the root of an instance document.
  Additionally, the unmarshal method allows for an unrecognized root element that
  has  an xsi:type attribute's value that references a type definition declared in
  the schema  to be unmarshalled as the root of an instance document.
  The <tt>JAXBContext</tt> object
  allows the merging of global elements and type definitions across a set of schemas (listed
  in the <tt>contextPath</tt>). Since each schema in the schema set can belong
  to distinct namespaces, the unification of schemas to an unmarshalling
  context should be namespace independent.  This means that a client
  application is able to unmarshal XML documents that are instances of
  any of the schemas listed in the <tt>contextPath</tt>.  For example:
  </p><pre>         JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance( "com.acme.foo:com.acme.bar" );
         Unmarshaller u = jc.createUnmarshaller();
         FooObject fooObj = (FooObject)u.unmarshal( new File( "foo.xml" ) ); // ok
         BarObject barObj = (BarObject)u.unmarshal( new File( "bar.xml" ) ); // ok
         BazObject bazObj = (BazObject)u.unmarshal( new File( "baz.xml" ) ); // error, "com.acme.baz" not in contextPath
  </pre>
  <p>
  The client application may also generate Java content trees explicitly rather
  than unmarshalling existing XML data.  For all JAXB-annotated value classes,
  an application can create content using constructors.
  For schema-derived interface/implementation classes and for the
  creation of elements that are not bound to a JAXB-annotated
  class, an application needs to have access and knowledge about each of
  the schema derived <tt> ObjectFactory</tt> classes that exist in each of
  java packages contained in the <tt>contextPath</tt>.  For each schema
  derived java class, there is a static factory method that produces objects
  of that type.  For example,
  assume that after compiling a schema, you have a package <tt>com.acme.foo</tt>
  that contains a schema derived interface named <tt>PurchaseOrder</tt>.  In
  order to create objects of that type, the client application would use the
  factory method like this:
  </p><pre>        com.acme.foo.PurchaseOrder po =
            com.acme.foo.ObjectFactory.createPurchaseOrder();
  </pre>
  <p>
  Once the client application has an instance of the the schema derived object,
  it can use the mutator methods to set content on it.
  </p><p>
  For more information on the generated <tt>ObjectFactory</tt> classes, see
  Section 4.2 <i>Java Package</i> of the specification.
  </p><p>
  <i><b>SPEC REQUIREMENT:</b> the provider must generate a class in each
  package that contains all of the necessary object factory methods for that
  package named ObjectFactory as well as the static
  <tt>newInstance( javaContentInterface )</tt> method</i>
  </p><h3>Marshalling</h3>
  <p>
  The <a href="../S/3939.html#L316" title="Defined at 316 in src/javax/xml/bind/Marshaller.java.">Marshaller</a> class provides the client application the ability
  to convert a Java content tree back into XML data.  There is no difference
  between marshalling a content tree that is created manually using the factory
  methods and marshalling a content tree that is the result an <tt>unmarshal
  </tt> operation.  Clients can marshal a java content tree back to XML data
  to a <tt>java.io.OutputStream</tt> or a <tt>java.io.Writer</tt>.  The
  marshalling process can alternatively produce SAX2 event streams to a
  registered <tt>ContentHandler</tt> or produce a DOM Node object.
  Client applications have control over the output encoding as well as
  whether or not to marshal the XML data as a complete document or
  as a fragment.
  </p><p>
  Here is a simple example that unmarshals an XML document and then marshals
  it back out:
  </p><pre>         JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance( "com.acme.foo" );
         // unmarshal from foo.xml
         Unmarshaller u = jc.createUnmarshaller();
         FooObject fooObj = (FooObject)u.unmarshal( new File( "foo.xml" ) );
         // marshal to System.out
         Marshaller m = jc.createMarshaller();
         m.marshal( fooObj, System.out );
  </pre>
  <h3>Validation</h3>
  <p>
  Validation has been changed significantly since JAXB 1.0.  The <a href="../D/9482.html" title="Multiple defined in 2 places.">Validator</a>
  class has been deprecated and made optional.  This means that you are advised
  not to use this class and, in fact, it may not even be available depending on
  your JAXB provider.  JAXB 1.0 client applications that rely on <tt>Validator</tt>
  will still work properly when deployed with the JAXB 1.0 runtime system.
  In JAXB 2.0, the <a href="../S/3943.html#L409" title="Defined at 409 in src/javax/xml/bind/Unmarshaller.java.">Unmarshaller</a> has included convenince methods that expose
  the JAXP 1.3 {@link javax.xml.validation} framework.  Please refer to the
  {@link Unmarshaller#setSchema(javax.xml.validation.Schema)} API for more
  information.
  </p><h3>JAXB Runtime Binding Framework Compatibility</h3>
  <p>
  The following JAXB 1.0 restriction only applies to binding schema to
  interfaces/implementation classes.
  Since this binding does not require a common runtime system, a JAXB
  client application must not attempt to mix runtime objects (<tt>JAXBContext,
  Marshaller</tt>, etc. ) from different providers.  This does not
  mean that the client application isn't portable, it simply means that a
  client has to use a runtime system provided by the same provider that was
  used to compile the schema.
  </p><h3>Discovery of JAXB implementation</h3>
  <p>
  When one of the <tt>newInstance</tt> methods is called, a JAXB implementation is discovered
  by the following steps.
  </p><ol>
  <li>
  For each package/class explicitly passed in to the <a href="#L294" title="Defined at 294.">newInstance</a> method, in the order they are specified,
  <tt>jaxb.properties</tt> file is looked up in its package, by using the associated classloader —
  this is {@link Class#getClassLoader() the owner class loader} for a <a href="../S/1722.html#L119" title="Defined at 119 in src/java/lang/Class.java.">Class</a> argument, and for a package
  the specified <a href="../D/1519.html" title="Multiple defined in 2 places.">ClassLoader</a>.
  <p>
  If such a file is discovered, it is {@link Properties#load(InputStream) loaded} as a property file, and
  the value of the {@link #JAXB_CONTEXT_FACTORY} key will be assumed to be the provider factory class.
  This class is then loaded by the associated classloader discussed above.
  </p><p>
  This phase of the look up allows some packages to force the use of a certain JAXB implementation.
  (For example, perhaps the schema compiler has generated some vendor extension in the code.)
  </p></li><li>
  If the system property {@link #JAXB_CONTEXT_FACTORY} exists, then its value is assumed to be the provider
  factory class. This phase of the look up enables per-JVM override of the JAXB implementation.
  </li><li>
  Look for <tt>/META-INF/services/javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext</tt> file in the associated classloader.
  This file follows the standard service descriptor convention, and if such a file exists, its content
  is assumed to be the provider factory class. This phase of the look up is for automatic discovery.
  It allows users to just put a JAXB implementation in a classpath and use it without any furhter configuration.
  </li><li>
  Finally, if all the steps above fail, then the rest of the look up is unspecified. That said,
  the recommended behavior is to simply look for some hard-coded platform default JAXB implementation.
  This phase of the look up is so that JavaSE can have its own JAXB implementation as the last resort.
  </li></ol>
  <p>
  Once the provider factory class is discovered, its
  <tt>public static JAXBContext createContext(String,ClassLoader,Map)</tt> method
  (see {@link #newInstance(String, ClassLoader, Map)} for the parameter semantics.)
  or <tt>public static JAXBContext createContet(Class[],Map)</tt> method
  (see {@link #newInstance(Class[], Map)} for the parameter semantics) are invoked
  to create a <a href="../R/4064.html" title="Multiple referred from 51 places.">JAXBContext</a>.

      Schema-derived

      Obtain a new instance of a <tt>JAXBContext</tt> class.

      The client application must supply a list of classes that the new
      context object needs to recognize.
      Not only the new context will recognize all the classes specified,
      but it will also recognize any classes that are directly/indirectly
      referenced statically from the specified classes. Subclasses of
      referenced classes nor <tt>@XmlTransient</tt> referenced classes
      are not registered with JAXBContext.
      For example, in the following Java code, if you do
      <tt>newInstance(Foo.class)</tt>, the newly created <a href="../R/4064.html" title="Multiple referred from 51 places.">JAXBContext</a>
      will recognize both <tt>Foo</tt> and <tt>Bar</tt>, but not <tt>Zot</tt> or <tt>FooBar</tt>:
      </p><pre>      class Foo {
           @XmlTransient FooBar c;
           Bar b;
      }
      class Bar { int x; }
      class Zot extends Bar { int y; }
      class FooBar { }
      </pre>
      Therefore, a typical client application only needs to specify the
      top-level classes, but it needs to be careful.
      <p>
      Note that for each java package registered with JAXBContext,
      when the optional package annotations exist, they must be processed.
      (see JLS, Section 7.4.1 "Named Packages").
