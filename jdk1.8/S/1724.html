      Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is
      supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by
      {@link java.util.HashMap}.
      <p>
      The general contract of <code>hashCode</code> is:
      </p><ul><li>Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
          an execution of a Java application, the <code>hashCode</code> method
          must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
          used in <code>equals</code> comparisons on the object is modified.
          This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
          application to another execution of the same application.
      </li><li>If two objects are equal according to the <code>equals(Object)</code>
          method, then calling the <code>hashCode</code> method on each of
          the two objects must produce the same integer result.
      </li><li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
          according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)}
          method, then calling the <code>hashCode</code> method on each of the
          two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
          programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
          for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
      </li></ul>
      <p>
      As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
      class <code>Object</code> does return distinct integers for distinct
      objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal
      address of the object into an integer, but this implementation
      technique is not required by the
      Javaâ„¢ programming language.)

      Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.
      <p>
      The <code>equals</code> method implements an equivalence relation
      on non-null object references:
      </p><ul><li>It is <i>reflexive</i>: for any non-null reference value
          <code>x</code>, <code>x.equals(x)</code> should return
          <code>true</code>.
      </li><li>It is <i>symmetric</i>: for any non-null reference values
          <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, <code>x.equals(y)</code>
          should return <code>true</code> if and only if
          <code>y.equals(x)</code> returns <code>true</code>.
      </li><li>It is <i>transitive</i>: for any non-null reference values
          <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, if
          <code>x.equals(y)</code> returns <code>true</code> and
          <code>y.equals(z)</code> returns <code>true</code>, then
          <code>x.equals(z)</code> should return <code>true</code>.
      </li><li>It is <i>consistent</i>: for any non-null reference values
          <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, multiple invocations of
          <code>x.equals(y)</code> consistently return <code>true</code>
          or consistently return <code>false</code>, provided no
          information used in <code>equals</code> comparisons on the
          objects is modified.
      </li><li>For any non-null reference value <code>x</code>,
          <code>x.equals(null)</code> should return <code>false</code>.
      </li></ul>
      <p>
      The <code>equals</code> method for class <code>Object</code> implements
      the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
      that is, for any non-null reference values <code>x</code> and
      <code>y</code>, this method returns <code>true</code> if and only
      if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> refer to the same object
      (<code>x == y</code> has the value <code>true</code>).
      </p><p>
      Note that it is generally necessary to override the <code>hashCode</code>
      method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
      general contract for the <code>hashCode</code> method, which states
      that equal objects must have equal hash codes.
      @param   obj   the reference object with which to compare.
      @return  <code>true</code> if this object is the same as the obj

      Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning
      of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
      intent is that, for any object <code>x</code>, the expression:
      <blockquote>
      <pre>      x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
      will be true, and that the expression:
      <blockquote>
      <pre>      x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
      will be <code>true</code>, but these are not absolute requirements.
      While it is typically the case that:
      <blockquote>
      <pre>      x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
      will be <code>true</code>, this is not an absolute requirement.
      <p>
      By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
      <code>super.clone</code>.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except
      <code>Object</code>) obey this convention, it will be the case that
      <code>x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</code>.
      </p><p>
      By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
      of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
      it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
      by <code>super.clone</code> before returning it.  Typically, this means
      copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
      of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
      objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
      primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
      the case that no fields in the object returned by <code>super.clone</code>
      need to be modified.
      </p><p>
      The method <code>clone</code> for class <code>Object</code> performs a
      specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
      not implement the interface <code>Cloneable</code>, then a
      <code>CloneNotSupportedException</code> is thrown. Note that all arrays
      are considered to implement the interface <code>Cloneable</code> and that
      the return type of the <code>clone</code> method of an array type <code>T[]</code>
      is <code>T[]</code> where T is any reference or primitive type.
      Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
      object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
      the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
      contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
      performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
      </p><p>
      The class <code>Object</code> does not itself implement the interface
      <code>Cloneable</code>, so calling the <code>clone</code> method on an object
      whose class is <code>Object</code> will result in throwing an
      exception at run time.
      @return     a clone of this instance.
      @throws  CloneNotSupportedException  if the object's class does not
                    support the <code>Cloneable</code> interface. Subclasses
                    that override the <code>clone</code> method can also
                    throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot
                    be cloned.

      Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the
      <code>toString</code> method returns a string that
      "textually represents" this object. The result should
      be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a
      person to read.
      It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.

      Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the
      {@link java.lang.Object#notify()} method or the
      {@link java.lang.Object#notifyAll()} method for this object, or a
      specified amount of time has elapsed.
      <p>
      The current thread must own this object's monitor.
      </p><p>
      This method causes the current thread (call it <var>T</var>) to
      place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish
      any and all synchronization claims on this object. Thread <var>T</var>
      becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant
      until one of four things happens:
      </p><ul><li>Some other thread invokes the <code>notify</code> method for this
      object and thread <var>T</var> happens to be arbitrarily chosen as
      the thread to be awakened.
      </li><li>Some other thread invokes the <code>notifyAll</code> method for this
      object.
      </li><li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
      thread <var>T</var>.
      </li><li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.  If
      <code>timeout</code> is zero, however, then real time is not taken into
      consideration and the thread simply waits until notified.
      </li></ul>
      The thread <var>T</var> is then removed from the wait set for this
      object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It then competes in the
      usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
      object; once it has gained control of the object, all its
      synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
      ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the <code>wait</code>
      method was invoked. Thread <var>T</var> then returns from the
      invocation of the <code>wait</code> method. Thus, on return from the
      <code>wait</code> method, the synchronization state of the object and of
      thread <code>T</code> is exactly as it was when the <code>wait</code> method
      was invoked.
      <p>
      A thread can also wake up without being notified, interrupted, or
      timing out, a so-called <i>spurious wakeup</i>.  While this will rarely
      occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for
      the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and
      continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied.  In other words,
      waits should always occur in loops, like this one:
      </p><pre>          synchronized (obj) {
              while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
                  obj.wait(timeout);
              ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
          }
      </pre>
      (For more information on this topic, see Section 3.2.3 in Doug Lea's
      "Concurrent Programming in Java (Second Edition)" (Addison-Wesley,
      2000), or Item 50 in Joshua Bloch's "Effective Java Programming
      Language Guide" (Addison-Wesley, 2001).
      <p>If the current thread is {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#interrupt()
      interrupted} by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an
      <code>InterruptedException</code> is thrown.  This exception is not
      thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as
      described above.
      </p><p>
      Note that the <code>wait</code> method, as it places the current thread
      into the wait set for this object, unlocks only this object; any
      other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain
      locked while the thread waits.

      Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the
      {@link java.lang.Object#notify()} method or the
      {@link java.lang.Object#notifyAll()} method for this object, or
      some other thread interrupts the current thread, or a certain
      amount of real time has elapsed.
      <p>
      This method is similar to the <code>wait</code> method of one
      argument, but it allows finer control over the amount of time to
      wait for a notification before giving up. The amount of real time,
      measured in nanoseconds, is given by:
      </p><blockquote>
      <pre>      1000000*timeout+nanos</pre></blockquote>
      <p>
      In all other respects, this method does the same thing as the
      method {@link #wait(long)} of one argument. In particular,
      <code>wait(0, 0)</code> means the same thing as <code>wait(0)</code>.
      </p><p>
      The current thread must own this object's monitor. The thread
      releases ownership of this monitor and waits until either of the
      following two conditions has occurred:
      </p><ul><li>Another thread notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor
          to wake up either through a call to the <code>notify</code> method
          or the <code>notifyAll</code> method.
      </li><li>The timeout period, specified by <code>timeout</code>
          milliseconds plus <code>nanos</code> nanoseconds arguments, has
          elapsed.
      </li></ul>
      <p>
      The thread then waits until it can re-obtain ownership of the
      monitor and resumes execution.
      </p><p>
      As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are
      possible, and this method should always be used in a loop:
      </p><pre>          synchronized (obj) {
              while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
                  obj.wait(timeout, nanos);
              ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
          }
      </pre>
      This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
      of this object's monitor. See the <code>notify</code> method for a
      description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
      a monitor.
      @param      timeout   the maximum time to wait in milliseconds.
      @param      nanos      additional time, in nanoseconds range
                            0-999999.
      @throws  IllegalArgumentException      if the value of timeout is
                           negative or the value of nanos is
                           not in the range 0-999999.
      @throws  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
                    the owner of this object's monitor.
      @throws  InterruptedException if any thread interrupted the
                  current thread before or while the current thread
                  was waiting for a notification.  The <i>interrupted
                  status</i> of the current thread is cleared when
                  this exception is thrown.</div>

      Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
      determines that there are no more references to the object.
      A subclass overrides the <code>finalize</code> method to dispose of
      system resources or to perform other cleanup.
      <p>
      The general contract of <code>finalize</code> is that it is invoked
      if and when the Javaâ„¢ virtual
      machine has determined that there is no longer any
      means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
      not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
      finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
      finalized. The <code>finalize</code> method may take any action, including
      making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
      of <code>finalize</code>, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
      the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
      for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
      explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
      permanently discarded.
      </p><p>
      The <code>finalize</code> method of class <code>Object</code> performs no
      special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
      <code>Object</code> may override this definition.
      </p><p>
      The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
      invoke the <code>finalize</code> method for any given object. It is
      guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
      be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
      invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
      the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
      </p><p>
      After the <code>finalize</code> method has been invoked for an object, no
      further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
      determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
      be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
      actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
      at which point the object may be discarded.
      </p><p>
      The <code>finalize</code> method is never invoked more than once by a Java
      virtual machine for any given object.
      </p><p>
      Any exception thrown by the <code>finalize</code> method causes
      the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
      ignored.
      @throws Throwable the <code>Exception</code> raised by this method
      @see java.lang.ref.WeakReference
      @see java.lang.ref.PhantomReference
