  Framework-level interface defining read-write access to a temporal object,
  such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.
  <p>
  This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects that
  are complete enough to be manipulated using plus and minus.
  It is implemented by those classes that can provide and manipulate information
  as {@linkplain TemporalField fields} or {@linkplain TemporalQuery queries}.
  See {@link TemporalAccessor} for the read-only version of this interface.
  </p><p>
  Most date and time information can be represented as a number.
  These are modeled using <code>TemporalField</code> with the number held using
  a <code>long</code> to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are
  simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.
  See {@link ChronoField} for the standard set of fields.
  </p><p>
  Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,
  the {@linkplain java.time.chrono.Chronology chronology} and the
  {@linkplain java.time.ZoneId time-zone}.
  These can be accessed via {@link #query(TemporalQuery) queries} using
  the static methods defined on {@link TemporalQuery}.
  </p><p>
  This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
  used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
  around instances of concrete types, such as <code>LocalDate</code>.
  There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations
  of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.
  See {@link java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate} for a fuller discussion of the issues.
  </p><h3>When to implement</h3>
  <p>
  A class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:
  </p><ul><li>it provides access to date/time/offset information, as per <code>TemporalAccessor</code>
  </li><li>the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest
  </li><li>the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the
   valid range of values for the fields that are represented
  </li></ul>
  <p>
  Four examples make this clear:
  </p><ul><li><code>LocalDate</code> implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
   that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine
   the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.
  </li><li><code>LocalTime</code> implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
   that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine
   validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.
  </li><li><code>MonthDay</code>, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement
   this interface.  While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,
   the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values
   for day-of-month.  As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.
  </li><li>The combination day-of-week and day-of-month ("Friday the 13th") should not implement
   this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps
   days to months.
  </li></ul>
  @implSpec
  This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
  however immutability is strongly recommended.
  All implementations must be {@link Comparable}.

      Checks if the specified unit is supported.
      <p>
      This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this date-time.
      If false, then calling the {@link #plus(long, TemporalUnit)} and
      {@link #minus(long, TemporalUnit) minus} methods will throw an exception.

      Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.
      <p>
      This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
      A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
      A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
      A selection of common adjustments is provided in
      {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters TemporalAdjusters}.
      These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
      The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
      lengths of month and leap years.

      Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:
      </p><pre>       date = date.with(Month.JULY);        // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster

      The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
      complete units between the two temporals.
      For example, the amount in hours between the times 11:30 and 13:29
      will only be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.
      </p><p>
      There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
      The first is to invoke this method directly.
      The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
      </p><pre>        // these two lines are equivalent
        temporal = start.until(end, unit);
        temporal = unit.between(start, end);
      </pre>
      The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
      <p>
      For example, this method allows the number of days between two dates to
      be calculated:
      </p><pre>       long daysBetween = start.until(end, DAYS);
       // or alternatively
       long daysBetween = DAYS.between(start, end);
      </pre>
      @implSpec
      Implementations must begin by checking to ensure that the input temporal
      object is of the same observable type as the implementation.
      They must then perform the calculation for all instances of {@link ChronoUnit}.
      An <code>UnsupportedTemporalTypeException</code> must be thrown for <code>ChronoUnit</code>
      instances that are unsupported.
      <p>
      If the unit is not a <code>ChronoUnit</code>, then the result of this method
      is obtained by invoking <code>TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)</code>
      passing <code>this</code> as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
      the second argument.
      </p><p>
      In summary, implementations must behave in a manner equivalent to this pseudo-code:
      </p><pre>       // convert the end temporal to the same type as this class
       if (unit instanceof ChronoUnit) {
         // if unit is supported, then calculate and return result
         // else throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for unsupported units
       }
       return unit.between(this, convertedEndTemporal);
      </pre>
      <p>
      Note that the unit's <code>between</code> method must only be invoked if the
      two temporal objects have exactly the same type evaluated by <code>getClass()</code>.
      </p><p>
      Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
      read-only method is invoked.
      @param endExclusive  the end temporal, exclusive, converted to be of the
       same type as this object, not null
      @param unit  the unit to measure the amount in, not null
      @return the amount of time between this temporal object and the specified one
       in terms of the unit; positive if the specified object is later than this one,
       negative if it is earlier than this one
      @throws DateTimeException if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
       temporal cannot be converted to the same type as this temporal
      @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
      @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs</p></div>
