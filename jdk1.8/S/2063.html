  A channel that can read bytes into a sequence of buffers.
  <p> A <i>scattering</i> read operation reads, in a single invocation, a
  sequence of bytes into one or more of a given sequence of buffers.
  Scattering reads are often useful when implementing network protocols or
  file formats that, for example, group data into segments consisting of one
  or more fixed-length headers followed by a variable-length body.  Similar
  <i>gathering</i> write operations are defined in the {@link
  GatheringByteChannel} interface.  </p>

      Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into a subsequence of the
      given buffers.
      <p> An invocation of this method attempts to read up to <i>r</i> bytes
      from this channel, where <i>r</i> is the total number of bytes remaining
      the specified subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,
      </p><blockquote><pre>      dsts[offset].remaining()
          + dsts[offset+1].remaining()
          + ... + dsts[offset+length-1].remaining()</pre></blockquote>
      at the moment that this method is invoked.
      <p> Suppose that a byte sequence of length <i>n</i> is read, where
      <tt>0</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&lt;=</tt>&nbsp;<i>n</i>&nbsp;<tt>&lt;=</tt>&nbsp;<i>r</i>.
      Up to the first <tt>dsts[offset].remaining()</tt> bytes of this sequence
      are transferred into buffer <tt>dsts[offset]</tt>, up to the next
      <tt>dsts[offset+1].remaining()</tt> bytes are transferred into buffer
      <tt>dsts[offset+1]</tt>, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence
      is transferred into the given buffers.  As many bytes as possible are
      transferred into each buffer, hence the final position of each updated
      buffer, except the last updated buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to
      that buffer's limit.
      </p><p> This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has
      already initiated a read operation upon this channel, however, then an
      invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
      complete. </p>
