  A channel for reading, writing, mapping, and manipulating a file.
  <p> A file channel is a {@link SeekableByteChannel} that is connected to
  a file. It has a current <i>position</i> within its file which can
  be both {@link #position() <i>queried</i>} and {@link #position(long)
  <i>modified</i>}.  The file itself contains a variable-length sequence
  of bytes that can be read and written and whose current {@link #size
  <i>size</i>} can be queried.  The size of the file increases
  when bytes are written beyond its current size; the size of the file
  decreases when it is {@link #truncate <i>truncated</i>}.  The
  file may also have some associated <i>metadata</i> such as access
  permissions, content type, and last-modification time; this class does not
  define methods for metadata access.
  </p><p> In addition to the familiar read, write, and close operations of byte
  channels, this class defines the following file-specific operations: </p>
  <ul><li><p> Bytes may be {@link #read(ByteBuffer, long) read} or
    {@link #write(ByteBuffer, long) <i>written</i>} at an absolute
    position in a file in a way that does not affect the channel's current
    position.  </p></li><li><p> A region of a file may be {@link #map <i>mapped</i>}
    directly into memory; for large files this is often much more efficient
    than invoking the usual <tt>read</tt> or <tt>write</tt> methods.
    </p></li><li><p> Updates made to a file may be {@link #force <i>forced
    out</i>} to the underlying storage device, ensuring that data are not
    lost in the event of a system crash.  </p></li><li><p> Bytes can be transferred from a file {@link #transferTo <i>to
    some other channel</i>}, and {@link #transferFrom <i>vice
    versa</i>}, in a way that can be optimized by many operating systems
    into a very fast transfer directly to or from the filesystem cache.
    </p></li><li><p> A region of a file may be {@link FileLock <i>locked</i>}
    against access by other programs.  </p></li>
  </ul>
  <p> File channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  The
  {@link Channel#close close} method may be invoked at any time, as specified
  by the {@link Channel} interface.  Only one operation that involves the
  channel's position or can change its file's size may be in progress at any
  given time; attempts to initiate a second such operation while the first is
  still in progress will block until the first operation completes.  Other
  operations, in particular those that take an explicit position, may proceed
  concurrently; whether they in fact do so is dependent upon the underlying
  implementation and is therefore unspecified.
  </p><p> The view of a file provided by an instance of this class is guaranteed
  to be consistent with other views of the same file provided by other
  instances in the same program.  The view provided by an instance of this
  class may or may not, however, be consistent with the views seen by other
  concurrently-running programs due to caching performed by the underlying
  operating system and delays induced by network-filesystem protocols.  This
  is true regardless of the language in which these other programs are
  written, and whether they are running on the same machine or on some other
  machine.  The exact nature of any such inconsistencies are system-dependent
  and are therefore unspecified.
  </p><p> A file channel is created by invoking one of the {@link #open open}
  methods defined by this class. A file channel can also be obtained from an
  existing {@link java.io.FileInputStream#getChannel FileInputStream}, {@link
  java.io.FileOutputStream#getChannel FileOutputStream}, or {@link
  java.io.RandomAccessFile#getChannel RandomAccessFile} object by invoking
  that object's <tt>getChannel</tt> method, which returns a file channel that
  is connected to the same underlying file. Where the file channel is obtained
  from an existing stream or random access file then the state of the file
  channel is intimately connected to that of the object whose <tt>getChannel</tt>
  method returned the channel.  Changing the channel's position, whether
  explicitly or by reading or writing bytes, will change the file position of
  the originating object, and vice versa. Changing the file's length via the
  file channel will change the length seen via the originating object, and vice
  versa.  Changing the file's content by writing bytes will change the content
  seen by the originating object, and vice versa.
  <a name="open-mode"></a> </p><p> At various points this class specifies that an
  instance that is "open for reading," "open for writing," or "open for
  reading and writing" is required.  A channel obtained via the {@link
  java.io.FileInputStream#getChannel getChannel} method of a {@link
  java.io.FileInputStream} instance will be open for reading.  A channel
  obtained via the {@link java.io.FileOutputStream#getChannel getChannel}
  method of a {@link java.io.FileOutputStream} instance will be open for
  writing.  Finally, a channel obtained via the {@link
  java.io.RandomAccessFile#getChannel getChannel} method of a {@link
  java.io.RandomAccessFile} instance will be open for reading if the instance
  was created with mode <tt>"r"</tt> and will be open for reading and writing
  if the instance was created with mode <tt>"rw"</tt>.
  <a name="append-mode"></a></p><p> A file channel that is open for writing may be in
  <i>append mode</i>, for example if it was obtained from a file-output stream
  that was created by invoking the {@link
  java.io.FileOutputStream#FileOutputStream(java.io.File,boolean)
  FileOutputStream(File,boolean)} constructor and passing <tt>true</tt> for
  the second parameter.  In this mode each invocation of a relative write
  operation first advances the position to the end of the file and then writes
  the requested data.  Whether the advancement of the position and the writing
  of the data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
  therefore unspecified.

      since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked,
      will have been written to that device.  This is useful for ensuring that
      critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash.

      <tt>false</tt> for this parameter indicates that only updates to the
      file's content need be written to storage; passing <tt>true</tt>
      indicates that updates to both the file's content and metadata must be
      written, which generally requires at least one more I/O operation.

      example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file's metadata, and
      this time is updated whenever the file is read.  Whether or not this is
      actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified.

      Maps a region of this channel's file directly into memory.
      <p> A region of a file may be mapped into memory in one of three modes:
      </p>
      <ul><li><p> <i>Read-only:</i> Any attempt to modify the resulting buffer
        will cause a {@link java.nio.ReadOnlyBufferException} to be thrown.
        ({@link MapMode#READ_ONLY MapMode.READ_ONLY}) </p></li><li><p> <i>Read/write:</i> Changes made to the resulting buffer will
        eventually be propagated to the file; they may or may not be made
        visible to other programs that have mapped the same file.  ({@link
        MapMode#READ_WRITE MapMode.READ_WRITE}) </p></li><li><p> <i>Private:</i> Changes made to the resulting buffer will not
        be propagated to the file and will not be visible to other programs
        that have mapped the same file; instead, they will cause private
        copies of the modified portions of the buffer to be created.  ({@link
        MapMode#PRIVATE MapMode.PRIVATE}) </p></li>
      </ul>
      <p> For a read-only mapping, this channel must have been opened for
      reading; for a read/write or private mapping, this channel must have
      been opened for both reading and writing.
      </p><p> The {@link MappedByteBuffer <i>mapped byte buffer</i>}
      returned by this method will have a position of zero and a limit and
      capacity of <tt>size</tt>; its mark will be undefined.  The buffer and
      the mapping that it represents will remain valid until the buffer itself
      is garbage-collected.
      </p><p> A mapping, once established, is not dependent upon the file channel
      that was used to create it.  Closing the channel, in particular, has no
      effect upon the validity of the mapping.
      </p><p> Many of the details of memory-mapped files are inherently dependent
      upon the underlying operating system and are therefore unspecified.  The
      behavior of this method when the requested region is not completely
      contained within this channel's file is unspecified.  Whether changes
      made to the content or size of the underlying file, by this program or
      another, are propagated to the buffer is unspecified.  The rate at which
      changes to the buffer are propagated to the file is unspecified.
      </p><p> For most operating systems, mapping a file into memory is more
      expensive than reading or writing a few tens of kilobytes of data via
      the usual {@link #read read} and {@link #write write} methods.  From the
      standpoint of performance it is generally only worth mapping relatively
      large files into memory.  </p>

      Attempts to acquire a lock on the given region of this channel's file.
      <p> This method does not block.  An invocation always returns
      immediately, either having acquired a lock on the requested region or
      having failed to do so.  If it fails to acquire a lock because an
      overlapping lock is held by another program then it returns
      <tt>null</tt>.  If it fails to acquire a lock for any other reason then
      an appropriate exception is thrown.
      </p><p> The region specified by the <tt>position</tt> and <tt>size</tt>
      parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual
      underlying file.  Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region
      initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the
      region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock.
      If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is
      required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the
      expected maximum size of the file, should be locked.  The zero-argument
      {@link #tryLock()} method simply locks a region of size {@link
      Long#MAX_VALUE}.
      </p><p> Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a
      request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for
      an exclusive lock.  Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or
      exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's {@link
      FileLock#isShared() isShared} method.
      </p><p> File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
      They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
      threads within the same virtual machine.  </p>
