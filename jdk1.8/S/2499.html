  The DGC abstraction is used for the server side of the distributed
  garbage collection algorithm. This interface contains the two
  methods: dirty and clean. A dirty call is made when a remote
  reference is unmarshaled in a client (the client is indicated by
  its VMID). A corresponding clean call is made when no more
  references to the remote reference exist in the client. A failed
  dirty call must schedule a strong clean call so that the call's
  sequence number can be retained in order to detect future calls
  received out of order by the distributed garbage collector.
  A reference to a remote object is leased for a period of time by
  the client holding the reference. The lease period starts when the
  dirty call is received. It is the client's responsibility to renew
  the leases, by making additional dirty calls, on the remote
  references it holds before such leases expire. If the client does
  not renew the lease before it expires, the distributed garbage
  collector assumes that the remote object is no longer referenced by
  that client.

      The dirty call requests leases for the remote object references
      associated with the object identifiers contained in the array
      'ids'. The 'lease' contains a client's unique VM identifier (VMID)
      and a requested lease period. For each remote object exported
      in the local VM, the garbage collector maintains a reference
      list-a list of clients that hold references to it. If the lease
      is granted, the garbage collector adds the client's VMID to the
      reference list for each remote object indicated in 'ids'. The
      'sequenceNum' parameter is a sequence number that is used to
      detect and discard late calls to the garbage collector. The
      sequence number should always increase for each subsequent call
      to the garbage collector.
      Some clients are unable to generate a VMID, since a VMID is a
      universally unique identifier that contains a host address
      which some clients are unable to obtain due to security
      restrictions. In this case, a client can use a VMID of null,
      and the distributed garbage collector will assign a VMID for
      the client.
      The dirty call returns a Lease object that contains the VMID
      used and the lease period granted for the remote references (a
      server may decide to grant a smaller lease period than the
      client requests). A client must use the VMID the garbage
      collector uses in order to make corresponding clean calls when
      the client drops remote object references.
      A client VM need only make one initial dirty call for each
      remote reference referenced in the VM (even if it has multiple
      references to the same remote object). The client must also
      make a dirty call to renew leases on remote references before
      such leases expire. When the client no longer has any
      references to a specific remote object, it must schedule a
      clean call for the object ID associated with the reference.

      The clean call removes the 'vmid' from the reference list of
      each remote object indicated in 'id's.  The sequence number is
      used to detect late clean calls.  If the argument 'strong' is
      true, then the clean call is a result of a failed dirty call,
      thus the sequence number for the client 'vmid' needs to be
      remembered.
