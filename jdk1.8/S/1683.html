  The management interface for the memory system of
  the Java virtual machine.
  <p> A Java virtual machine has a single instance of the implementation
  class of this interface.  This instance implementing this interface is
  an <a href="ManagementFactory.html#MXBean">MXBean</a>
  that can be obtained by calling
  the {@link ManagementFactory#getMemoryMXBean} method or
  from the {@link ManagementFactory#getPlatformMBeanServer
  platform <tt>MBeanServer</tt>} method.
  </p><p>The <tt>ObjectName</tt> for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
  the memory system within an MBeanServer is:
  </p><blockquote>
     {@link ManagementFactory#MEMORY_MXBEAN_NAME
            <tt>java.lang:type=Memory</tt>}
  </blockquote>
  It can be obtained by calling the
  {@link PlatformManagedObject#getObjectName} method.
  <h3> Memory </h3>
  The memory system of the Java virtual machine manages
  the following kinds of memory:
  <h3> 1. Heap </h3>
  The Java virtual machine has a <i>heap</i> that is the runtime
  data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays
  are allocated.  It is created at the Java virtual machine start-up.
  Heap memory for objects is reclaimed by an automatic memory management
  system which is known as a <i>garbage collector</i>.
  <p>The heap may be of a fixed size or may be expanded and shrunk.
  The memory for the heap does not need to be contiguous.
  </p><h3> 2. Non-Heap Memory</h3>
  The Java virtual machine manages memory other than the heap
  (referred as <i>non-heap memory</i>).
  <p> The Java virtual machine has a <i>method area</i> that is shared
  among all threads.
  The method area belongs to non-heap memory.  It stores per-class structures
  such as a runtime constant pool, field and method data, and the code for
  methods and constructors.  It is created at the Java virtual machine
  start-up.
  </p><p> The method area is logically part of the heap but a Java virtual
  machine implementation may choose not to either garbage collect
  or compact it.  Similar to the heap, the method area may be of a
  fixed size or may be expanded and shrunk.  The memory for the
  method area does not need to be contiguous.
  </p><p>In addition to the method area, a Java virtual machine
  implementation may require memory for internal processing or
  optimization which also belongs to non-heap memory.
  For example, the JIT compiler requires memory for storing the native
  machine code translated from the Java virtual machine code for
  high performance.
  </p><h3>Memory Pools and Memory Managers</h3>
  {@link MemoryPoolMXBean Memory pools} and
  {@link MemoryManagerMXBean memory managers} are the abstract entities
  that monitor and manage the memory system
  of the Java virtual machine.
  <p>A memory pool represents a memory area that the Java virtual machine
  manages.  The Java virtual machine has at least one memory pool
  and it may create or remove memory pools during execution.
  A memory pool can belong to either the heap or the non-heap memory.
  </p><p>A memory manager is responsible for managing one or more memory pools.
  The garbage collector is one type of memory manager responsible
  for reclaiming memory occupied by unreachable objects.  A Java virtual
  machine may have one or more memory managers.   It may
  add or remove memory managers during execution.
  A memory pool can be managed by more than one memory manager.
  </p><h3>Memory Usage Monitoring</h3>
  Memory usage is a very important monitoring attribute for the memory system.
  The memory usage, for example, could indicate:
  <ul><li>the memory usage of an application,</li><li>the workload being imposed on the automatic memory management system,</li><li>potential memory leakage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The memory usage can be monitored in three ways:
  </p><ul><li>Polling</li><li>Usage Threshold Notification</li><li>Collection Usage Threshold Notification</li>
  </ul>
  Details are specified in the {@link MemoryPoolMXBean} interface.
  <p>The memory usage monitoring mechanism is intended for load-balancing
  or workload distribution use.  For example, an application would stop
  receiving any new workload when its memory usage exceeds a
  certain threshold. It is not intended for an application to detect
  and recover from a low memory condition.
  </p><h3>Notifications</h3>
  <p>This <tt>MemoryMXBean</tt> is a
  {@link javax.management.NotificationEmitter NotificationEmitter}
  that emits two types of memory {@link javax.management.Notification
  notifications} if any one of the memory pools
  supports a <a href="MemoryPoolMXBean.html#UsageThreshold">usage threshold</a>
  or a <a href="MemoryPoolMXBean.html#CollectionThreshold">collection usage
  threshold</a> which can be determined by calling the
  {@link MemoryPoolMXBean#isUsageThresholdSupported} and
  {@link MemoryPoolMXBean#isCollectionUsageThresholdSupported} methods.
  </p><ul><li>{@link MemoryNotificationInfo#MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED
        usage threshold exceeded notification} - for notifying that
        the memory usage of a memory pool is increased and has reached
        or exceeded its
        <a href="MemoryPoolMXBean.html#UsageThreshold"> usage threshold</a> value.
        </li><li>{@link MemoryNotificationInfo#MEMORY_COLLECTION_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED
        collection usage threshold exceeded notification} - for notifying that
        the memory usage of a memory pool is greater than or equal to its
        <a href="MemoryPoolMXBean.html#CollectionThreshold">
        collection usage threshold</a> after the Java virtual machine
        has expended effort in recycling unused objects in that
        memory pool.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The notification emitted is a {@link javax.management.Notification}
  instance whose {@link javax.management.Notification#setUserData
  user data} is set to a {@link CompositeData CompositeData}
  that represents a {@link MemoryNotificationInfo} object
  containing information about the memory pool when the notification
  was constructed. The <tt>CompositeData</tt> contains the attributes
  as described in {@link MemoryNotificationInfo#from
  MemoryNotificationInfo}.
  </p><hr>
  <h3>NotificationEmitter</h3>
  The <tt>MemoryMXBean</tt> object returned by
  {@link ManagementFactory#getMemoryMXBean} implements
  the {@link javax.management.NotificationEmitter NotificationEmitter}
  interface that allows a listener to be registered within the
  <tt>MemoryMXBean</tt> as a notification listener.
  Below is an example code that registers a <tt>MyListener</tt> to handle
  notification emitted by the <tt>MemoryMXBean</tt>.
  <blockquote><pre>  class MyListener implements javax.management.NotificationListener {
      public void handleNotification(Notification notif, Object handback) {
          // handle notification
          ....
      }
  }
  MemoryMXBean mbean = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();
  NotificationEmitter emitter = (NotificationEmitter) mbean;
  MyListener listener = new MyListener();
  emitter.addNotificationListener(listener, null, null);
  </pre></blockquote>
