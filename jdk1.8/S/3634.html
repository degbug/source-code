  <p>MBean interface for connector servers.  A JMX API connector server

      <p>Deactivates the connector server, that is, stops listening for
      client connections.  Calling this method will also close all
      client connections that were made by this server.  After this
      method returns, whether normally or with an exception, the
      connector server will not create any new client
      connections.</p>
      <p>Once a connector server has been stopped, it cannot be started
      again.</p>
      <p>Calling this method when the connector server has already
      been stopped has no effect.  Calling this method when the
      connector server has not yet been started will disable the
      connector server object permanently.</p>
      <p>If closing a client connection produces an exception, that
      exception is not thrown from this method.  A {@link
      JMXConnectionNotification} with type {@link
      JMXConnectionNotification#FAILED} is emitted from this MBean
      with the connection ID of the connection that could not be
      closed.</p>
      <p>Closing a connector server is a potentially slow operation.
      For example, if a client machine with an open connection has
      crashed, the close operation might have to wait for a network
      protocol timeout.  Callers that do not want to block in a close
      operation should do it in a separate thread.</p>
      @exception IOException if the server cannot be closed cleanly.
      When this exception is thrown, the server has already attempted
      to close all client connections.  All client connections are
      closed except possibly those that generated exceptions when the
      server attempted to close them.</div>
