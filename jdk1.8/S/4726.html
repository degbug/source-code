<div class="comment">
  Denote an instruction that may throw a run-time or a linking
  exception (or both) during execution.  This is not quite the truth
  as such; because all instructions may throw an
  java.lang.VirtualMachineError. These exceptions are omitted.
  The Lava Language Specification specifies exactly which
  <i>RUN-TIME</i> and which <i>LINKING</i> exceptions each
  instruction may throw which is reflected by the implementers.  Due
  to the structure of the JVM specification, it may be possible that
  an Instruction implementing this interface returns a Class[] of
  size 0.
  Please note that we speak of an "exception" here when we mean any
  "Throwable" object; so this term is equally used for "Exception"
  and "Error" objects.
