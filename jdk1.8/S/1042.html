  A <code>ReadWriteLock</code> maintains a pair of associated {@link
  Lock locks}, one for read-only operations and one for writing.
  The <a href="#L125" title="Defined at 125.">readLock</a> may be held simultaneously by
  multiple reader threads, so long as there are no writers.  The
  <a href="#L132" title="Defined at 132.">writeLock</a> is exclusive.
  <p>All <code>ReadWriteLock</code> implementations must guarantee that
  the memory synchronization effects of <code>writeLock</code> operations
  (as specified in the <a href="../D/5200.html" title="Multiple defined in 4 places.">Lock</a> interface) also hold with respect
  to the associated <code>readLock</code>. That is, a thread successfully
  acquiring the read lock will see all updates made upon previous
  release of the write lock.
  </p><p>A read-write lock allows for a greater level of concurrency in
  accessing shared data than that permitted by a mutual exclusion lock.
  It exploits the fact that while only a single thread at a time (a
  <em>writer</em> thread) can modify the shared data, in many cases any
  number of threads can concurrently read the data (hence <em>reader</em>
  threads).
  In theory, the increase in concurrency permitted by the use of a read-write
  lock will lead to performance improvements over the use of a mutual
  exclusion lock. In practice this increase in concurrency will only be fully
  realized on a multi-processor, and then only if the access patterns for
  the shared data are suitable.
  </p><p>Whether or not a read-write lock will improve performance over the use
  of a mutual exclusion lock depends on the frequency that the data is
  read compared to being modified, the duration of the read and write
  operations, and the contention for the data - that is, the number of
  threads that will try to read or write the data at the same time.
  For example, a collection that is initially populated with data and
  thereafter infrequently modified, while being frequently searched
  (such as a directory of some kind) is an ideal candidate for the use of
  a read-write lock. However, if updates become frequent then the data
  spends most of its time being exclusively locked and there is little, if any
  increase in concurrency. Further, if the read operations are too short
  the overhead of the read-write lock implementation (which is inherently
  more complex than a mutual exclusion lock) can dominate the execution
  cost, particularly as many read-write lock implementations still serialize
  all threads through a small section of code. Ultimately, only profiling
  and measurement will establish whether the use of a read-write lock is
  suitable for your application.
  </p><p>Although the basic operation of a read-write lock is straight-forward,
  there are many policy decisions that an implementation must make, which
  may affect the effectiveness of the read-write lock in a given application.
  Examples of these policies include:
  </p><ul><li>Determining whether to grant the read lock or the write lock, when
  both readers and writers are waiting, at the time that a writer releases
  the write lock. Writer preference is common, as writes are expected to be
  short and infrequent. Reader preference is less common as it can lead to
  lengthy delays for a write if the readers are frequent and long-lived as
  expected. Fair, or "in-order" implementations are also possible.
  </li><li>Determining whether readers that request the read lock while a
  reader is active and a writer is waiting, are granted the read lock.
  Preference to the reader can delay the writer indefinitely, while
  preference to the writer can reduce the potential for concurrency.
  </li><li>Determining whether the locks are reentrant: can a thread with the
  write lock reacquire it? Can it acquire a read lock while holding the
  write lock? Is the read lock itself reentrant?
  </li><li>Can the write lock be downgraded to a read lock without allowing
  an intervening writer? Can a read lock be upgraded to a write lock,
  in preference to other waiting readers or writers?
  </li></ul>
  You should consider all of these things when evaluating the suitability
  of a given implementation for your application.
