    Client-side request interceptor.
    <p>
    A request Interceptor is designed to intercept the flow of a 
    request/reply sequence through the ORB at specific points so that 
    services can query the request information and manipulate the service 
    contexts which are propagated between clients and servers. The primary 
    use of request Interceptors is to enable ORB services to transfer 
    context information between clients and servers. There are two types 
    of request Interceptors: client-side and server-side. 
    </p><p>
    To write a client-side Interceptor, implement the 
    <code>ClientRequestInterceptor</code> interface.

      Allows an Interceptor to query information during a Time-Independent

      With TII, an application may poll for a response to a request sent 
      previously by the polling client or some other client. This poll is 
      reported to Interceptors through the <code>send_poll</code> 
      interception point and the response is returned through the 
      <code>receive_reply</code> or <code>receive_exception</code> 
      interception points.  If the response is not available before the

      Indicates to the interceptor that an exception occurred.  Allows
      an Interceptor to query the exception's information before it is 
      thrown to the client.
      <p>
      This interception point may throw a system exception. This has the 
      effect of changing the exception which successive Interceptors 
      popped from the Flow Stack receive on their calls to 
      <code>receive_exception</code>. The exception thrown to the client 
      will be the last exception thrown by an Interceptor, or the original 
      exception if no Interceptor changes the exception. 
      </p><p>
      This interception point may also throw a <code>ForwardRequest</code> 
      exception.  If an Interceptor throws this exception, no other 
      Interceptors' <code>receive_exception</code> operations are called. 
      The remaining Interceptors in the Flow Stack are popped and have their 
      <code>receive_other</code> interception point called. 
      </p><p>
      If the <code>completion_status</code> of the exception is not 
      <code>COMPLETED_NO</code>, then it is inappropriate for this 
      interception point to throw a <code>ForwardRequest</code> exception. 
      The request s at-most-once semantics would be lost. 
      </p><p>
      Compliant Interceptors shall properly follow 
      <code>completion_status</code> semantics if they throw a system 
      exception from this interception point. If the original exception is 
      a system exception, the <code>completion_status</code> of the new 
      exception shall be the same as on the original. If the original 
      exception is a user exception, then the <code>completion_status</code> 
      of the new exception shall be <code>COMPLETED_YES</code>. 
      </p><p>
      Under some conditions, depending on what policies are in effect, an 
      exception (such as <code>COMM_FAILURE</code>) may result in a retry 
      of the request. While this retry is a new request with respect to 
      Interceptors, there is one point of correlation between the original 
      request and the retry: because control has not returned to the 
      client, the <code>PortableInterceptor.Current</code> for both the 
      original request and the retrying request is the same.
      @param ri Information about the current request being intercepted.
      @exception ForwardRequest If thrown, indicates to the ORB that a
          retry of the request should occur with the new object given in

      Allows an Interceptor to query the information available when a 
      request results in something other than a normal reply or an 
      exception. For example, a request could result in a retry 
      (e.g., a GIOP Reply with a <code>LOCATION_FORWARD</code> status was 
      received); or on asynchronous calls, the reply does not immediately 
      follow the request, but control shall return to the client and an 
      ending interception point shall be called. 
      <p>
      For retries, depending on the policies in effect, a new request may or 
      may not follow when a retry has been indicated. If a new request does 
      follow, while this request is a new request, with respect to 
      Interceptors, there is one point of correlation between the original 
      request and the retry: because control has not returned to the client, 
      the request scoped <code>PortableInterceptor.Current</code> for both 
      the original request and the retrying request is the same.
