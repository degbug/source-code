  This class is for security permissions.
  A SecurityPermission contains a name (also referred to as a "target name")
  but no actions list; you either have the named permission
  or you don't.
  <p>
  The target name is the name of a security configuration parameter (see below).
  Currently the SecurityPermission object is used to guard access
  to the Policy, Security, Provider, Signer, and Identity
  objects.
  </p><p>
  The following table lists all the possible SecurityPermission target names,
  and for each provides a description of what the permission allows
  and a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission.
  </p><table border="1" cellpadding="5" summary="target name,what the permission allows, and associated risks">
  <tbody><tr>
  <th>Permission Target Name</th>
  <th>What the Permission Allows</th>
  <th>Risks of Allowing this Permission</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>createAccessControlContext</td>
    <td>Creation of an AccessControlContext</td>
    <td>This allows someone to instantiate an AccessControlContext
  with a <code>DomainCombiner</code>.  Extreme care must be taken when
  granting this permission. Malicious code could create a DomainCombiner
  that augments the set of permissions granted to code, and even grant the
  code {@link java.security.AllPermission}.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>getDomainCombiner</td>
    <td>Retrieval of an AccessControlContext's DomainCombiner</td>
    <td>This allows someone to retrieve an AccessControlContext's
  <code>DomainCombiner</code>.  Since DomainCombiners may contain
  sensitive information, this could potentially lead to a privacy leak.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>getPolicy</td>
    <td>Retrieval of the system-wide security policy (specifically, of the
  currently-installed Policy object)</td>
    <td>This allows someone to query the policy via the
  <code>getPermissions</code> call,
  which discloses which permissions would be granted to a given CodeSource.
  While revealing the policy does not compromise the security of
  the system, it does provide malicious code with additional information
  which it may use to better aim an attack. It is wise
  not to divulge more information than necessary.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setPolicy</td>
    <td>Setting of the system-wide security policy (specifically,
  the Policy object)</td>
    <td>Granting this permission is extremely dangerous, as malicious
  code may grant itself all the necessary permissions it needs
  to successfully mount an attack on the system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>createPolicy.{policy type}</td>
    <td>Getting an instance of a Policy implementation from a provider</td>
    <td>Granting this permission enables code to obtain a Policy object.
  Malicious code may query the Policy object to determine what permissions
  have been granted to code other than itself. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>getProperty.{key}</td>
    <td>Retrieval of the security property with the specified key</td>
    <td>Depending on the particular key for which access has
  been granted, the code may have access to the list of security
  providers, as well as the location of the system-wide and user
  security policies.  while revealing this information does not
  compromise the security of the system, it does provide malicious
  code with additional information which it may use to better aim
  an attack.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setProperty.{key}</td>
    <td>Setting of the security property with the specified key</td>
    <td>This could include setting a security provider or defining
  the location of the system-wide security policy.  Malicious
  code that has permission to set a new security provider may
  set a rogue provider that steals confidential information such
  as cryptographic private keys. In addition, malicious code with
  permission to set the location of the system-wide security policy
  may point it to a security policy that grants the attacker
  all the necessary permissions it requires to successfully mount
  an attack on the system.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>insertProvider</td>
    <td>Addition of a new provider</td>
    <td>This would allow somebody to introduce a possibly
  malicious provider (e.g., one that discloses the private keys passed
  to it) as the highest-priority provider. This would be possible
  because the Security object (which manages the installed providers)
  currently does not check the integrity or authenticity of a provider
  before attaching it. The "insertProvider" permission subsumes the
  "insertProvider.{provider name}" permission (see the section below for
  more information).
  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>removeProvider.{provider name}</td>
    <td>Removal of the specified provider</td>
    <td>This may change the behavior or disable execution of other
  parts of the program. If a provider subsequently requested by the
  program has been removed, execution may fail. Also, if the removed
  provider is not explicitly requested by the rest of the program, but
  it would normally be the provider chosen when a cryptography service
  is requested (due to its previous order in the list of providers),
  a different provider will be chosen instead, or no suitable provider
  will be found, thereby resulting in program failure.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>clearProviderProperties.{provider name}</td>
    <td>"Clearing" of a Provider so that it no longer contains the properties
  used to look up services implemented by the provider</td>
    <td>This disables the lookup of services implemented by the provider.
  This may thus change the behavior or disable execution of other
  parts of the program that would normally utilize the Provider, as
  described under the "removeProvider.{provider name}" permission.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>putProviderProperty.{provider name}</td>
    <td>Setting of properties for the specified Provider</td>
    <td>The provider properties each specify the name and location
  of a particular service implemented by the provider. By granting
  this permission, you let code replace the service specification
  with another one, thereby specifying a different implementation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>removeProviderProperty.{provider name}</td>
    <td>Removal of properties from the specified Provider</td>
    <td>This disables the lookup of services implemented by the
  provider. They are no longer accessible due to removal of the properties
  specifying their names and locations. This
  may change the behavior or disable execution of other
  parts of the program that would normally utilize the Provider, as
  described under the "removeProvider.{provider name}" permission.</td>
  </tr>

  <p>
  The following permissions have been superseded by newer permissions or are
  associated with classes that have been deprecated: {@link Identity},
  {@link IdentityScope}, {@link Signer}. Use of them is discouraged. See the
  applicable classes for more information.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>insertProvider.{provider name}</td>
    <td>Addition of a new provider, with the specified name</td>
    <td>Use of this permission is discouraged from further use because it is
  possible to circumvent the name restrictions by overriding the
  {@link java.security.Provider#getName} method. Also, there is an equivalent
  level of risk associated with granting code permission to insert a provider
  with a specific name, or any name it chooses. Users should use the
  "insertProvider" permission instead.
  <p>This would allow somebody to introduce a possibly
  malicious provider (e.g., one that discloses the private keys passed
  to it) as the highest-priority provider. This would be possible
  because the Security object (which manages the installed providers)
  currently does not check the integrity or authenticity of a provider
  before attaching it.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setSystemScope</td>
    <td>Setting of the system identity scope</td>
    <td>This would allow an attacker to configure the system identity scope with
  certificates that should not be trusted, thereby granting applet or
  application code signed with those certificates privileges that
  would have been denied by the system's original identity scope.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setIdentityPublicKey</td>
    <td>Setting of the public key for an Identity</td>
    <td>If the identity is marked as "trusted", this allows an attacker to
  introduce a different public key (e.g., its own) that is not trusted
  by the system's identity scope, thereby granting applet or
  application code signed with that public key privileges that
  would have been denied otherwise.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setIdentityInfo</td>
    <td>Setting of a general information string for an Identity</td>
    <td>This allows attackers to set the general description for
  an identity.  This may trick applications into using a different
  identity than intended or may prevent applications from finding a
  particular identity.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>addIdentityCertificate</td>
    <td>Addition of a certificate for an Identity</td>
    <td>This allows attackers to set a certificate for
  an identity's public key.  This is dangerous because it affects
  the trust relationship across the system. This public key suddenly
  becomes trusted to a wider audience than it otherwise would be.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>removeIdentityCertificate</td>
    <td>Removal of a certificate for an Identity</td>
    <td>This allows attackers to remove a certificate for
  an identity's public key. This is dangerous because it affects
  the trust relationship across the system. This public key suddenly
  becomes considered less trustworthy than it otherwise would be.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>printIdentity</td>
   <td>Viewing the name of a principal
  and optionally the scope in which it is used, and whether
  or not it is considered "trusted" in that scope</td>
   <td>The scope that is printed out may be a filename, in which case
  it may convey local system information. For example, here's a sample
  printout of an identity named "carol", who is
  marked not trusted in the user's identity database:<br>
    carol[/home/luehe/identitydb.obj][not trusted]</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>getSignerPrivateKey</td>
    <td>Retrieval of a Signer's private key</td>
    <td>It is very dangerous to allow access to a private key; private
  keys are supposed to be kept secret. Otherwise, code can use the
  private key to sign various files and claim the signature came from
  the Signer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setSignerKeyPair</td>
    <td>Setting of the key pair (public key and private key) for a Signer</td>
    <td>This would allow an attacker to replace somebody else's (the "target's")
  keypair with a possibly weaker keypair (e.g., a keypair of a smaller
  keysize).  This also would allow the attacker to listen in on encrypted
  communication between the target and its peers. The target's peers
  might wrap an encryption session key under the target's "new" public
  key, which would allow the attacker (who possesses the corresponding
  private key) to unwrap the session key and decipher the communication
  data encrypted under that session key.</td>
