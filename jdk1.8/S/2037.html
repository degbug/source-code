<div class="comment">
  A network channel that supports Internet Protocol (IP) multicasting.
  <p> IP multicasting is the transmission of IP datagrams to members of
  a <em>group</em> that is zero or more hosts identified by a single destination
  address.
  </p><p> In the case of a channel to an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET IPv4} socket,
  the underlying operating system supports <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2236.txt">
  <i>RFC&nbsp;2236: Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2 (IGMPv2)</i></a>.
  It may optionally support source filtering as specified by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3376.txt"> <i>RFC&nbsp;3376: Internet Group
  Management Protocol, Version 3 (IGMPv3)</i></a>.
  For channels to an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET6 IPv6} socket, the equivalent
  standards are <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2710.txt"> <i>RFC&nbsp;2710:
  Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6</i></a> and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3810.txt"> <i>RFC&nbsp;3810: Multicast Listener
  Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6</i></a>.
  </p><p> The {@link #join(InetAddress,NetworkInterface)} method is used to
  join a group and receive all multicast datagrams sent to the group. A channel
  may join several multicast groups and may join the same group on several
  {@link NetworkInterface interfaces}. Membership is dropped by invoking the {@link
  MembershipKey#drop drop} method on the returned {@link MembershipKey}. If the
  underlying platform supports source filtering then the {@link MembershipKey#block
  block} and {@link MembershipKey#unblock unblock} methods can be used to block or
  unblock multicast datagrams from particular source addresses.
  </p><p> The {@link #join(InetAddress,NetworkInterface,InetAddress)} method
  is used to begin receiving datagrams sent to a group whose source address matches
  a given source address. This method throws {@link UnsupportedOperationException}
  if the underlying platform does not support source filtering.  Membership is
  <em>cumulative</em> and this method may be invoked again with the same group
  and interface to allow receiving datagrams from other source addresses. The
  method returns a {@link MembershipKey} that represents membership to receive
  datagrams from the given source address. Invoking the key's {@link
  MembershipKey#drop drop} method drops membership so that datagrams from the
  source address can no longer be received.
  </p><h2>Platform dependencies</h2>
  The multicast implementation is intended to map directly to the native
  multicasting facility. Consequently, the following items should be considered
  when developing an application that receives IP multicast datagrams:
  <ol>
  <li><p> The creation of the channel should specify the {@link ProtocolFamily}
  that corresponds to the address type of the multicast groups that the channel
  will join. There is no guarantee that a channel to a socket in one protocol
  family can join and receive multicast datagrams when the address of the
  multicast group corresponds to another protocol family. For example, it is
  implementation specific if a channel to an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET6 IPv6}
  socket can join an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET IPv4} multicast group and receive
  multicast datagrams sent to the group. </p></li><li><p> The channel's socket should be bound to the {@link
  InetAddress#isAnyLocalAddress wildcard} address. If the socket is bound to
  a specific address, rather than the wildcard address then it is implementation
  specific if multicast datagrams are received by the socket. </p></li><li><p> The {@link StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} option should be
  enabled prior to {@link NetworkChannel#bind binding} the socket. This is
  required to allow multiple members of the group to bind to the same
  address. </p></li>
  </ol>
  <p> <b>Usage Example:</b>
  </p><pre>      // join multicast group on this interface, and also use this
      // interface for outgoing multicast datagrams
      NetworkInterface ni = NetworkInterface.getByName("hme0");
      DatagramChannel dc = DatagramChannel.open(StandardProtocolFamily.INET)
          .setOption(StandardSocketOptions.SO_REUSEADDR, true)
          .bind(new InetSocketAddress(5000))
          .setOption(StandardSocketOptions.IP_MULTICAST_IF, ni);
      InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("225.4.5.6");
      MembershipKey key = dc.join(group, ni);
