  Strategy for querying a temporal object.
  <p>
  Queries are a key tool for extracting information from temporal objects.
  They exist to externalize the process of querying, permitting different
  approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.
  Examples might be a query that checks if the date is the day before February 29th
  in a leap year, or calculates the number of days to your next birthday.
  </p><p>
  The {@link TemporalField} interface provides another mechanism for querying
  temporal objects. That interface is limited to returning a <code>long</code>.
  By contrast, queries can return any type.
  </p><p>
  There are two equivalent ways of using a <code>TemporalQuery</code>.
  The first is to invoke the method on this interface directly.
  The second is to use {@link TemporalAccessor#query(TemporalQuery)}:
  </p><pre>    // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
    temporal = thisQuery.queryFrom(temporal);
    temporal = temporal.query(thisQuery);
  </pre>
  It is recommended to use the second approach, <code>query(TemporalQuery)</code>,
  as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
  <p>
  The most common implementations are method references, such as
  <code>LocalDate::from</code> and <code>ZoneId::from</code>.
  Additional common queries are provided as static methods in {@link TemporalQueries}.
  @implSpec
  This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
  however immutability is strongly recommended.
  @param <r> the type returned from the query
  @since 1.8</r></p></div>

      Queries the specified temporal object.
      <p>
      This queries the specified temporal object to return an object using the logic
      encapsulated in the implementing class.
      Examples might be a query that checks if the date is the day before February 29th
      in a leap year, or calculates the number of days to your next birthday.

      as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
      @implSpec
      The implementation must take the input object and query it.
      The implementation defines the logic of the query and is responsible for
      documenting that logic.
      It may use any method on <code>TemporalAccessor</code> to determine the result.
      The input object must not be altered.
      <p>
      The input temporal object may be in a calendar system other than ISO.
      Implementations may choose to document compatibility with other calendar systems,
      or reject non-ISO temporal objects by {@link TemporalQueries#chronology() querying the chronology}.
      </p><p>
      This method may be called from multiple threads in parallel.
      It must be thread-safe when invoked.
      @param temporal  the temporal object to query, not null
      @return the queried value, may return null to indicate not found
      @throws DateTimeException if unable to query
      @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs</p></div>
