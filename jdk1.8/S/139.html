   <code>LSParserFilter</code>s provide applications the ability to examine
  nodes as they are being constructed while parsing. As each node is
  examined, it may be modified or removed, or the entire parse may be
  terminated early.
  <p> At the time any of the filter methods are called by the parser, the
  owner Document and DOMImplementation objects exist and are accessible.
  The document element is never passed to the <code>LSParserFilter</code>
  methods, i.e. it is not possible to filter out the document element.
  <code>Document</code>, <code>DocumentType</code>, <code>Notation</code>,
  <code>Entity</code>, and <code>Attr</code> nodes are never passed to the
  <code>acceptNode</code> method on the filter. The child nodes of an
  <code>EntityReference</code> node are passed to the filter if the
  parameter "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#parameter-entities">
  entities</a>" is set to <code>false</code>. Note that, as described by the parameter "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#parameter-entities">
  entities</a>", unexpanded entity reference nodes are never discarded and are always
  passed to the filter.
  </p><p> All validity checking while parsing a document occurs on the source
  document as it appears on the input stream, not on the DOM document as it
  is built in memory. With filters, the document in memory may be a subset
  of the document on the stream, and its validity may have been affected by
  the filtering.
  </p><p> All default attributes must be present on elements when the elements
  are passed to the filter methods. All other default content must be
  passed to the filter methods.
  </p><p> DOM applications must not raise exceptions in a filter. The effect of
  throwing exceptions from a filter is DOM implementation dependent.
  </p><p>See also the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-LS-20040407">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load
and Save Specification</a>.</p></div>

       The parser will call this method after each <code>Element</code> start
      tag has been scanned, but before the remainder of the
      <code>Element</code> is processed. The intent is to allow the
      element, including any children, to be efficiently skipped. Note that
      only element nodes are passed to the <code>startElement</code>
      function.
      <br>The element node passed to <code>startElement</code> for filtering
      will include all of the Element's attributes, but none of the
      children nodes. The Element may not yet be in place in the document
      being constructed (it may not have a parent node.)
      <br>A <code>startElement</code> filter function may access or change
      the attributes for the Element. Changing Namespace declarations will
      have no effect on namespace resolution by the parser.
      <br>For efficiency, the Element node passed to the filter may not be
      the same one as is actually placed in the tree if the node is
      accepted. And the actual node (node object identity) may be reused
      during the process of reading in and filtering a document.
      @param elementArg The newly encountered element. At the time this
        method is called, the element is incomplete - it will have its
        attributes, but no children.
      @return
      <ul><li> <code>FILTER_ACCEPT</code> if the <code>Element</code> should
        be included in the DOM document being built.
      </li><li>
        <code>FILTER_REJECT</code> if the <code>Element</code> and all of
        its children should be rejected.
      </li><li> <code>FILTER_SKIP</code> if the
        <code>Element</code> should be skipped. All of its children are
        inserted in place of the skipped <code>Element</code> node.
      </li><li>
        <code>FILTER_INTERRUPT</code> if the filter wants to stop the
        processing of the document. Interrupting the processing of the
        document does no longer guarantee that the resulting DOM tree is
        XML well-formed. The <code>Element</code> is rejected.
      </li>
      </ul> Returning
        any other values will result in unspecified behavior.</div>

      This method will be called by the parser at the completion of the
      parsing of each node. The node and all of its descendants will exist
      and be complete. The parent node will also exist, although it may be
      incomplete, i.e. it may have additional children that have not yet
      been parsed. Attribute nodes are never passed to this function.
      <br>From within this method, the new node may be freely modified -
      children may be added or removed, text nodes modified, etc. The state
      of the rest of the document outside this node is not defined, and the
      affect of any attempt to navigate to, or to modify any other part of
      the document is undefined.
      <br>For validating parsers, the checks are made on the original
      document, before any modification by the filter. No validity checks
      are made on any document modifications made by the filter.
      <br>If this new node is rejected, the parser might reuse the new node
      and any of its descendants.
      @param nodeArg The newly constructed element. At the time this method
        is called, the element is complete - it has all of its children
        (and their children, recursively) and attributes, and is attached
        as a child to its parent.
      @return
      <ul><li> <code>FILTER_ACCEPT</code> if this <code>Node</code> should
        be included in the DOM document being built.
      </li><li>
        <code>FILTER_REJECT</code> if the <code>Node</code> and all of its
        children should be rejected.
      </li><li> <code>FILTER_SKIP</code> if the
        <code>Node</code> should be skipped and the <code>Node</code>
        should be replaced by all the children of the <code>Node</code>.
      </li><li>
        <code>FILTER_INTERRUPT</code> if the filter wants to stop the
        processing of the document. Interrupting the processing of the
        document does no longer guarantee that the resulting DOM tree is
        XML well-formed. The <code>Node</code> is accepted and will be the
        last completely parsed node.

       Tells the <code>LSParser</code> what types of nodes to show to the
      method <code>LSParserFilter.acceptNode</code>. If a node is not shown
      to the filter using this attribute, it is automatically included in
      the DOM document being built. See <code>NodeFilter</code> for
      definition of the constants. The constants <code>SHOW_ATTRIBUTE</code>
      , <code>SHOW_DOCUMENT</code>, <code>SHOW_DOCUMENT_TYPE</code>,
      <code>SHOW_NOTATION</code>, <code>SHOW_ENTITY</code>, and
      <code>SHOW_DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT</code> are meaningless here. Those nodes
      will never be passed to <code>LSParserFilter.acceptNode</code>.
