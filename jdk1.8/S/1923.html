      Delete on close. When this option is present then the implementation
      makes a <em>best effort</em> attempt to delete the file when closed
      by the appropriate <code>close</code> method. If the <code>close</code> method is
      not invoked then a <em>best effort</em> attempt is made to delete the
      file when the Java virtual machine terminates (either normally, as
      defined by the Java Language Specification, or where possible, abnormally).
      This option is primarily intended for use with <em>work files</em> that
      are used solely by a single instance of the Java virtual machine. This
      option is not recommended for use when opening files that are open
      concurrently by other entities. Many of the details as to when and how
      the file is deleted are implementation specific and therefore not
      specified. In particular, an implementation may be unable to guarantee
      that it deletes the expected file when replaced by an attacker while the
      file is open. Consequently, security sensitive applications should take
      care when using this option.
      <p> For security reasons, this option may imply the {@link
      LinkOption#NOFOLLOW_LINKS} option. In other words, if the option is present
      when opening an existing file that is a symbolic link then it may fail
      (by throwing {@link java.io.IOException}).</p></div>

      Sparse file. When used with the {@link #CREATE_NEW} option then this

      sparse files.</div>
