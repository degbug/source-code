  A multiplexor of {@link SelectableChannel} objects.
  <p> A selector may be created by invoking the {@link #open open} method of
  this class, which will use the system's default {@link
  java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider selector provider} to
  create a new selector.  A selector may also be created by invoking the
  {@link java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider#openSelector openSelector}
  method of a custom selector provider.  A selector remains open until it is
  closed via its {@link #close close} method.
  <a name="ks"></a>
  </p><p> A selectable channel's registration with a selector is represented by a
  {@link SelectionKey} object.  A selector maintains three sets of selection
  keys:
  </p><ul><li><p> The <i>key set</i> contains the keys representing the current
    channel registrations of this selector.  This set is returned by the
    {@link #keys() keys} method. </p></li><li><p> The <i>selected-key set</i> is the set of keys such that each
    key's channel was detected to be ready for at least one of the operations
    identified in the key's interest set during a prior selection operation.
    This set is returned by the {@link #selectedKeys() selectedKeys} method.
    The selected-key set is always a subset of the key set. </p></li><li><p> The <i>cancelled-key</i> set is the set of keys that have been
    cancelled but whose channels have not yet been deregistered.  This set is
    not directly accessible.  The cancelled-key set is always a subset of the
    key set. </p></li>
  </ul>
  <p> All three sets are empty in a newly-created selector.
  </p><p> A key is added to a selector's key set as a side effect of registering a
  channel via the channel's {@link SelectableChannel#register(Selector,int)
  register} method.  Cancelled keys are removed from the key set during
  selection operations.  The key set itself is not directly modifiable.
  </p><p> A key is added to its selector's cancelled-key set when it is cancelled,
  whether by closing its channel or by invoking its {@link SelectionKey#cancel
  cancel} method.  Cancelling a key will cause its channel to be deregistered
  during the next selection operation, at which time the key will removed from
  all of the selector's key sets.
  <a name="sks"></a></p><p> Keys are added to the selected-key set by selection
  operations.  A key may be removed directly from the selected-key set by
  invoking the set's {@link java.util.Set#remove(java.lang.Object) remove}
  method or by invoking the {@link java.util.Iterator#remove() remove} method
  of an {@link java.util.Iterator iterator} obtained from the
  set.  Keys are never removed from the selected-key set in any other way;
  they are not, in particular, removed as a side effect of selection
  operations.  Keys may not be added directly to the selected-key set. </p>
  <a name="selop"></a>
  <h2>Selection</h2>
  <p> During each selection operation, keys may be added to and removed from a
  selector's selected-key set and may be removed from its key and
  cancelled-key sets.  Selection is performed by the {@link #select()}, {@link
  #select(long)}, and {@link #selectNow()} methods, and involves three steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><p> Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
    which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered.  This step leaves
    the cancelled-key set empty. </p></li><li><p> The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
    readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
    identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
    operation began.  For a channel that is ready for at least one such
    operation, one of the following two actions is performed: </p>
    <ol>
      <li><p> If the channel's key is not already in the selected-key set then
      it is added to that set and its ready-operation set is modified to
      identify exactly those operations for which the channel is now reported
      to be ready.  Any readiness information previously recorded in the ready
      set is discarded.  </p></li><li><p> Otherwise the channel's key is already in the selected-key set,
      so its ready-operation set is modified to identify any new operations
      for which the channel is reported to be ready.  Any readiness
      information previously recorded in the ready set is preserved; in other
      words, the ready set returned by the underlying system is
      bitwise-disjoined into the key's current ready set. </p></li><li><p> If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
    in progress then they are processed as in step (1). </p></li><li><p> By invoking the selector's {@link #wakeup wakeup} method,
    </p></li><li><p> By invoking the selector's {@link #close close} method, or
    </p></li><li><p> By invoking the blocked thread's {@link
    java.lang.Thread#interrupt() interrupt} method, in which case its
    interrupt status will be set and the selector's {@link #wakeup wakeup}
    method will be invoked. </p></li>
  <p> The {@link #close close} method synchronizes on the selector and all
  three key sets in the same order as in a selection operation.
  <a name="ksc"></a>
  </p><p> A selector's key and selected-key sets are not, in general, safe for use
  by multiple concurrent threads.  If such a thread might modify one of these
  sets directly then access should be controlled by synchronizing on the set
  itself.  The iterators returned by these sets' {@link
  java.util.Set#iterator() iterator} methods are <i>fail-fast:</i> If the set
  is modified after the iterator is created, in any way except by invoking the
  iterator's own {@link java.util.Iterator#remove() remove} method, then a
  {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException} will be thrown. </p>
