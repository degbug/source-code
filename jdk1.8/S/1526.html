  Support for time-zones and their rules.
  </p>
  <p>
  Daylight Saving Time and Time-Zones are concepts used by Governments to alter local time.
  This package provides support for time-zones, their rules and the resulting
  gaps and overlaps in the local time-line typically caused by Daylight Saving Time.
  </p>
  <h3>Package specification</h3>
  <p>
  Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in any class or interface
  in this package will cause a {@link java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown.
  The Javadoc "@param" definition is used to summarise the null-behavior.
  The "@throws {@link java.lang.NullPointerException}" is not explicitly documented in each method.
  </p>
  <p>
  All calculations should check for numeric overflow and throw either an {@link java.lang.ArithmeticException}
  or a {@link java.time.DateTimeException}.
  </p>
  @since JDK1.8</div>
