<div class="comment">
  A field may be annotated as stable if all of its component variables
  changes value at most once.
  A field's value counts as its component value.
  If the field is typed as an array, then all the non-null components
  of the array, of depth up to the rank of the field's array type,
  also count as component values.
  By extension, any variable (either array or field) which has annotated
  as stable is called a stable variable, and its non-null or non-zero
  value is called a stable value.
  <p>
  Since all fields begin with a default value of null for references
  (resp., zero for primitives), it follows that this annotation indicates
  that the first non-null (resp., non-zero) value stored in the field
  will never be changed.
  </p><p>
  If the field is not of an array type, there are no array elements,
  then the value indicated as stable is simply the value of the field.
  If the dynamic type of the field value is an array but the static type
  is not, the components of the array are <em>not</em> regarded as stable.
  </p><p>
  If the field is an array type, then both the field value and
  all the components of the field value (if the field value is non-null)
  are indicated to be stable.
  If the field type is an array type with rank <code>N &gt; 1</code>,
  then each component of the field value (if the field value is non-null),
  is regarded as a stable array of rank <code>N-1</code>.
  </p><p>
  Fields which are declared <code>final</code> may also be annotated as stable.
  Since final fields already behave as stable values, such an annotation
  indicates no additional information, unless the type of the field is
  an array type.
  </p><p>
  It is (currently) undefined what happens if a field annotated as stable
  is given a third value.  In practice, if the JVM relies on this annotation
  to promote a field reference to a constant, it may be that the Java memory
  model would appear to be broken, if such a constant (the second value of the field)
  is used as the value of the field even after the field value has changed.</p></div>
