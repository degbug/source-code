  An asynchronous channel that can read and write bytes.
  <p> Some channels may not allow more than one read or write to be outstanding
  at any given time. If a thread invokes a read method before a previous read
  operation has completed then a {@link ReadPendingException} will be thrown.
  Similarly, if a write method is invoked before a previous write has completed
  then {@link WritePendingException} is thrown. Whether or not other kinds of
  I/O operations may proceed concurrently with a read operation depends upon
  the type of the channel.
  </p><p> Note that {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer ByteBuffers} are not safe for use by
  multiple concurrent threads. When a read or write operation is initiated then
  care must be taken to ensure that the buffer is not accessed until the
  operation completes.

      Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer.
      <p> This method initiates an asynchronous read operation to read a

      operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
      handler is the number of bytes read or <code>-1</code> if no bytes could be

      <i>r</i> is 0, the read operation completes immediately with a result of
