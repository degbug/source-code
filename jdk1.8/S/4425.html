  A <code>VoiceStatus</code> object contains information about the current
  status of one of the voices produced by a {@link Synthesizer}.
  <p>
  MIDI synthesizers are generally capable of producing some maximum number of
  simultaneous notes, also referred to as voices.  A voice is a stream
  of successive single notes, and the process of assigning incoming MIDI notes to
  specific voices is known as voice allocation.
  However, the voice-allocation algorithm and the contents of each voice are
  normally internal to a MIDI synthesizer and hidden from outside view.  One can, of
  course, learn from MIDI messages which notes the synthesizer is playing, and
  one might be able deduce something about the assignment of notes to voices.
  But MIDI itself does not provide a means to report which notes a
  synthesizer has assigned to which voice, nor even to report how many voices
  the synthesizer is capable of synthesizing.
  </p><p>
  In Java Sound, however, a
  <code>Synthesizer</code> class can expose the contents of its voices through its
  {@link Synthesizer#getVoiceStatus() getVoiceStatus()} method.
  This behavior is recommended but optional;
  synthesizers that don't expose their voice allocation simply return a
  zero-length array. A <code>Synthesizer</code> that does report its voice status
  should maintain this information at
  all times for all of its voices, whether they are currently sounding or
  not.  In other words, a given type of <code>Synthesizer</code> always has a fixed
  number of voices, equal to the maximum number of simultaneous notes it is
  capable of sounding.
  </p><p>
  <a name="description_of_active"></a>
  If the voice is not currently processing a MIDI note, it
  is considered inactive.  A voice is inactive when it has
  been given no note-on commands, or when every note-on command received has
  been terminated by a corresponding note-off (or by an "all notes off"
  message).  For example, this happens when a synthesizer capable of playing 16
  simultaneous notes is told to play a four-note chord; only
  four voices are active in this case (assuming no earlier notes are still playing).
  Usually, a voice whose status is reported as active is producing audible sound, but this
  is not always true; it depends on the details of the instrument (that
  is, the synthesis algorithm) and how long the note has been going on.
  For example, a voice may be synthesizing the sound of a single hand-clap.  Because
  this sound dies away so quickly, it may become inaudible before a note-off
  message is received.  In such a situation, the voice is still considered active
  even though no sound is currently being produced.
  </p><p>
  Besides its active or inactive status, the <code>VoiceStatus</code> class
  provides fields that reveal the voice's current MIDI channel, bank and
  program number, MIDI note number, and MIDI volume.  All of these can
  change during the course of a voice.  While the voice is inactive, each
  of these fields has an unspecified value, so you should check the active
  field first.

      The bank number of the instrument that this voice is currently using.
      This is a number dictated by the MIDI bank-select message; it does not
