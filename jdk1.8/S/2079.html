<div class="comment">
  A channel that supports asynchronous I/O operations. Asynchronous I/O
  operations will usually take one of two forms:
  <ol>
  <li><pre>{@link Future}&lt;V&gt; <em>operation</em>(<em>...</em>)</pre></li><li><pre>void <em>operation</em>(<em>...</em> A attachment, {@link
    CompletionHandler}&lt;V,? super A&gt; handler)</pre></li>
  </ol>
  where <i>operation</i> is the name of the I/O operation (read or write for
  example), <i>V</i> is the result type of the I/O operation, and <i>A</i> is
  the type of an object attached to the I/O operation to provide context when
  consuming the result. The attachment is important for cases where a
  <em>state-less</em> <code>CompletionHandler</code> is used to consume the result
  of many I/O operations.
  <p> In the first form, the methods defined by the {@link Future Future}
  interface may be used to check if the operation has completed, wait for its
  completion, and to retrieve the result. In the second form, a {@link
  CompletionHandler} is invoked to consume the result of the I/O operation when
  it completes or fails.
  </p><p> A channel that implements this interface is <em>asynchronously
  closeable</em>: If an I/O operation is outstanding on the channel and the
  channel's <a href="#L116" title="Defined at 116.">close</a> method is invoked, then the I/O operation
  fails with the exception {@link AsynchronousCloseException}.
  </p><p> Asynchronous channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
  Some channel implementations may support concurrent reading and writing, but
  may not allow more than one read and one write operation to be outstanding at
  any given time.
  </p><h2>Cancellation</h2>
  <p> The <code>Future</code> interface defines the {@link Future#cancel cancel}
  method to cancel execution. This causes all threads waiting on the result of
  the I/O operation to throw {@link java.util.concurrent.CancellationException}.
  Whether the underlying I/O operation can be cancelled is highly implementation
  specific and therefore not specified. Where cancellation leaves the channel,
  or the entity to which it is connected, in an inconsistent state, then the
  channel is put into an implementation specific <em>error state</em> that
  prevents further attempts to initiate I/O operations that are <i>similar</i>
  to the operation that was cancelled. For example, if a read operation is
  cancelled but the implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been
  read from the channel then it puts the channel into an error state; further
  attempts to initiate a <code>read</code> operation cause an unspecified runtime
  exception to be thrown. Similarly, if a write operation is cancelled but the
  implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written to the
  channel then subsequent attempts to initiate a <code>write</code> will fail with
  an unspecified runtime exception.
  </p><p> Where the {@link Future#cancel cancel} method is invoked with the {@code
  mayInterruptIfRunning} parameter set to <code>true</code> then the I/O operation
  may be interrupted by closing the channel. In that case all threads waiting
  on the result of the I/O operation throw <code>CancellationException</code> and
  any other I/O operations outstanding on the channel complete with the
  exception {@link AsynchronousCloseException}.
  </p><p> Where the <code>cancel</code> method is invoked to cancel read or write
  operations then it is recommended that all buffers used in the I/O operations
  be discarded or care taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while
  the channel remains open.

      Closes this channel.
      <p> Any outstanding asynchronous operations upon this channel will
      complete with the exception {@link AsynchronousCloseException}. After a
      channel is closed, further attempts to initiate asynchronous I/O
      operations complete immediately with cause {@link ClosedChannelException}.
