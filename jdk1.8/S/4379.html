  A source data line is a data line to which data may be written.  It acts as
  a source to its mixer. An application writes audio bytes to a source data line,
  which handles the buffering of the bytes and delivers them to the mixer.
  The mixer may mix the samples with those from other sources and then deliver
  the mix to a target such as an output port (which may represent an audio output
  device on a sound card).
  <p>
  Note that the naming convention for this interface reflects the relationship
  between the line and its mixer.  From the perspective of an application,
  a source data line may act as a target for audio data.
  </p><p>
  A source data line can be obtained from a mixer by invoking the
  <code>{@link Mixer#getLine getLine}</code> method of <code>Mixer</code> with
  an appropriate <code>{@link DataLine.Info}</code> object.
  </p><p>
  The <code>SourceDataLine</code> interface provides a method for writing
  audio data to the data line's buffer. Applications that play or mix
  audio should write data to the source data line quickly enough to keep the
  buffer from underflowing (emptying), which could cause discontinuities in
  the audio that are perceived as clicks.  Applications can use the
  <code>{@link DataLine#available available}</code> method defined in the
  <code>DataLine</code> interface to determine the amount of data currently
  queued in the data line's buffer.  The amount of data which can be written
  to the buffer without blocking is the difference between the buffer size
  and the amount of queued data.  If the delivery of audio output
  stops due to underflow, a <code>{@link LineEvent.Type#STOP STOP}</code> event is
  generated.  A <code>{@link LineEvent.Type#START START}</code> event is generated
  when the audio output resumes.

      Writes audio data to the mixer via this source data line.  The requested
      number of bytes of data are read from the specified array,
      starting at the given offset into the array, and written to the data
      line's buffer.  If the caller attempts to write more data than can
      currently be written (see <code>{@link DataLine#available available}</code>),
      this method blocks until the requested amount of data has been written.
      This applies even if the requested amount of data to write is greater
      than the data line's buffer size.  However, if the data line is closed,
      stopped, or flushed before the requested amount has been written,
      the method no longer blocks, but returns the number of bytes
      written thus far.
      <p>
      The number of bytes that can be written without blocking can be ascertained
      using the <code>{@link DataLine#available available}</code> method of the
      <code>DataLine</code> interface.  (While it is guaranteed that
      this number of bytes can be written without blocking, there is no guarantee
      that attempts to write additional data will block.)
      </p><p>
      The number of bytes to write must represent an integral number of
      sample frames, such that:
      <br>
      </p><center><code>[ bytes written ] % [frame size in bytes ] == 0</code></center>
      <br>
      The return value will always meet this requirement.  A request to write a
      number of bytes representing a non-integral number of sample frames cannot
      be fulfilled and may result in an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.
      @param b a byte array containing data to be written to the data line
      @param len the length, in bytes, of the valid data in the array
      (in other words, the requested amount of data to write, in bytes)
      @param off the offset from the beginning of the array, in bytes
      @return the number of bytes actually written
      @throws IllegalArgumentException if the requested number of bytes does
      not represent an integral number of sample frames,
      or if <code>len</code> is negative
      @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if <code>off</code> is negative,
      or <code>off+len</code> is greater than the length of the array
      <code>b</code>.
